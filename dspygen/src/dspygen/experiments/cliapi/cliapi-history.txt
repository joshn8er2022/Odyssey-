Express
Express.js is arguably the most popular web framework for Node.js

A typical app structure for express celebrates the notion of routes and handlers, while views and data are left for interpretation (probably because the rise of microservices and client-side apps).

So an app structure may look like this:

app/
  routes.js
  handlers/
    health.js
    shazam.js
While routes.js glues everything together:

// ... some code ...
const health = require('./handlers/health')
const shazam = require('./handlers/shazam')
app.get('/health', health)
app.post('/shazam', shazam)

module.exports = app
Unlike React Native, you could dynamically load modules here. However, there's still a need for judgement when constructing the routes (app.get/post part).

Using hygen let's see how we could build something like this:

$ hygen route new --method post --name auth
Since we've been through a few templates as with previous use cases, let's jump straight to the interesting part, the inject part.

So let's say our generator is structured like this:

_templates/
  route/
    new/
      handler.ejs.t
      inject_handler.ejs.t
Then inject_handler looks like this:

Copy
---
inject: true
to: app/routes.js
skip_if: <%= name %>
before: "module.exports = app"
---
app.<%= method %>('/<%= name %>', <%= name %>)
Note how we're anchoring this inject to before: "module.exports = app". If in previous occasions we appended content to a given line, we're now prepending it.


Redux
Redux is the posterchild of hygen. It doesn't matter what level of granularity you select for your Redux architecture, you're still going to end up with a lot of boilerplate.

For my app architecture I mostly choose ducks, which helps remove a little bit of boilerplate and have modularity baked in.

My typical Redux architecture would look like this:

app/
  components/
    icon.js
    avatar.js
  modules/
    boot.js     <---- glues modules together, requires chat, app, and auth.
    app/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    auth/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    chat/
      index.js  <---- the 'connect' bit for Redux.
      view.js   <---- the view, separated, for testing.
      state.js  <---- reducer, actions, types, selectors.
Adding a Module#
Being a modular architecture, there's a huge plus for adding a module. It just means adding a folder, and index, view, state, perhaps a default component, a storybook story, and wiring every thing togather such as a reducer, exported actions and more in boot.js. Fun.

Should be a breeze with hygen. Here's how your templates look like:

_templates/
  module/
    new/
      index.ejs.t
      view.ejs.t
      state.ejs.t
      inject_boot.ejs.t   <--- adds a 'require' clause to boot.js
Here's how index looks like:

---
to: app/modules/<%= name %>/index.js
---
//
// requires, mappings, etc....
//
export default connect(...)(<%= Name %>)
A similar trick would do for view and state.

How would we add a require line given that boot.js looks like this?

// ... some bootstrapping code ...

const modules = [
  //     --- we want to inject "after" this
  require('auth').default,
  require('app').default
]

// ... rest of bootstrapping code ...
Let's build inject_boot.ejs.t. We have to use inject: true because this is an inject template and to locate our injected line after const modules =...:

---
to: app/modules/boot.js
inject: true
skip_if: <%= name %>
after: "const modules = ["
---
require('./<%= name %>).default,
After running it, we end up with this:

Copy
// ... some bootstrapping code ...

const modules = [
  require('chat').default
  require('auth').default,
  require('app').default
]

// ... rest of bootstrapping code ...
And we're done! Generating a new module is saying this:

$ hygen module new --name settings

### Example Structure

app/ routes.js handlers/ health.js shazam.js

vbnet


- **routes.js**: Centralizes route definitions.
- **handlers/**: Contains individual request handlers.

## Route Management

**routes.js** binds routes to their respective handlers.

```javascript
const health = require('./handlers/health')
const shazam = require('./handlers/shazam')

app.get('/health', health)
app.post('/shazam', shazam)

module.exports = app
Dynamic Module Loading: Unlike some frameworks, Express.js allows dynamic loading of modules.
Route Construction: Careful judgment is required when defining app.get and app.post routes.
Hygen Generators

# Building a Modular Express.js and Redux Application with Hygen

Creating a scalable and maintainable web application often involves structuring your codebase thoughtfully and automating repetitive tasks. In this guide, we'll explore how to integrate **Express.js**, **Redux**, and **Hygen** to build a robust application architecture. We'll walk through setting up your Express server, managing state with Redux, and using Hygen to automate boilerplate code generation.

## Setting Up Express.js

**Express.js** is a minimalistic and flexible web framework for Node.js, widely recognized for its simplicity and powerful routing capabilities. A typical Express application focuses on defining routes and their corresponding handlers, leaving views and data management to be tailored based on specific requirements, such as microservices or client-side applications.

### App Structure

A well-organized Express application might have the following structure:

app/ routes.js handlers/ health.js shazam.js

vbnet


- **routes.js**: Centralizes all route definitions.
- **handlers/**: Contains individual request handlers for different endpoints.

### Defining Routes

In `app/routes.js`, you bind routes to their respective handlers:

```javascript
const health = require('./handlers/health');
const shazam = require('./handlers/shazam');

app.get('/health', health);
app.post('/shazam', shazam);

module.exports = app;
This setup allows for easy scalability, enabling you to add more routes and handlers as your application grows.

Automating with Hygen
Hygen is a powerful code generator that helps automate the creation of boilerplate code, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. By defining templates, Hygen can generate new routes, modules, and other components with ease.

Creating a New Route
To generate a new route using Hygen, you can run:

bash

$ hygen route new --method post --name auth
This command utilizes predefined templates to create the necessary handler and inject the route into app/routes.js.

Template Structure
Your Hygen templates for routes might look like this:

arduino

_templates/
  route/
    new/
      handler.ejs.t
      inject_handler.ejs.t
inject_handler.ejs.t
ejs

---
inject: true
to: app/routes.js
skip_if: <%= name %>
before: "module.exports = app"
---
app.<%= method %>('/<%= name %>', <%= name %>);
This template injects the new route definition into app/routes.js just before the module is exported, ensuring that your routes are organized and up-to-date.

Managing State with Redux
Redux serves as a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, offering a centralized way to manage state across your app. Despite its reputation for boilerplate, adopting the ducks pattern can enhance modularity and reduce redundancy.

Redux Architecture
A typical Redux setup within your application might follow this structure:

css

app/
  components/
    icon.js
    avatar.js
  modules/
    boot.js
    app/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    auth/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    chat/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
components/: Houses reusable UI components.
modules/: Contains feature-specific logic, each with its own index.js, view.js, and state.js.
boot.js: Initializes and combines all modules.
Adding a New Module
With a modular architecture, adding a new module is straightforward. For example, to add a settings module, run:

bash

$ hygen module new --name settings
Template Structure
Hygen templates for modules might be organized as follows:

arduino

_templates/
  module/
    new/
      index.ejs.t
      view.ejs.t
      state.ejs.t
      inject_boot.ejs.t
inject_boot.ejs.t
ejs

---
to: app/modules/boot.js
inject: true
skip_if: <%= name %>
after: "const modules = ["
---
require('./<%= name %>').default,
This template injects the new module into app/modules/boot.js by appending a require statement after the existing modules array.

Resulting boot.js
After running the generator, your boot.js will look like this:

javascript

// ... some bootstrapping code ...

const modules = [
  require('chat').default,
  require('auth').default,
  require('app').default,
  require('settings').default,
];

// ... rest of bootstrapping code ...
This ensures that your new settings module is seamlessly integrated into the application.

Integrating Express.js, Redux, and Hygen
Combining Express.js, Redux, and Hygen creates a harmonious development environment where server-side routing, state management, and code generation work together seamlessly.

Express.js handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers.
Redux manages the application state, providing a predictable and centralized state container.
Hygen automates the creation of new routes and modules, reducing manual boilerplate and ensuring consistency.
Example Workflow
Define a New Route:

bash

$ hygen route new --method post --name login
This generates a new handler app/handlers/login.js and injects the route into app/routes.js.

Create a New Redux Module:

bash

$ hygen module new --name user
This creates a new module under app/modules/user/ with index.js, view.js, and state.js, and updates boot.js to include the new module.

Implement Handler and State Logic:

app/handlers/login.js:
javascript

module.exports = (req, res) => {
  // Handle login logic
  res.send('Login successful');
};
app/modules/user/state.js:
javascript

// Initial state
const initialState = {
  isAuthenticated: false,
  user: null,
};

// Actions
const LOGIN_SUCCESS = 'user/LOGIN_SUCCESS';
const LOGOUT = 'user/LOGOUT';

// Reducer
export default function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, isAuthenticated: true, user: action.payload };
    case LOGOUT:
      return { ...state, isAuthenticated: false, user: null };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Action Creators
export const loginSuccess = (user) => ({
  type: LOGIN_SUCCESS,
  payload: user,
});

export const logout = () => ({
  type: LOGOUT,
});
Best Practices
Modular Architecture: Organize your codebase into modules to promote scalability and maintainability.
Automated Code Generation: Utilize tools like Hygen to minimize boilerplate and maintain consistency.
Atomic Notes: Ensure each module or component has a single responsibility, enhancing clarity and testability.
Backlinking: Connect related modules and components within your documentation for easy navigation and reference.

# Building a Full CRUD Application with Express, React, Redux, and Hygen

## Common Misconceptions

Before diving into building a full CRUD application, it's essential to address some common misconceptions that developers might have about the involved technologies:

1. **Express.js and React are interchangeable**:
   - *Reality*: **Express.js** is a backend framework for Node.js, handling server-side operations, while **React** is a frontend library for building user interfaces.

2. **Redux is mandatory for state management in React**:
   - *Reality*: While **Redux** provides a robust solution for state management, smaller applications might benefit from React's built-in state management or other libraries like Context API.

3. **Hygen is only for generating boilerplate code**:
   - *Reality*: **Hygen** can also be used to automate various repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency and reducing the potential for human error.

4. **Full CRUD applications require separate repositories for frontend and backend**:
   - *Reality*: While separating concerns is beneficial, integrating both frontend and backend in a single repository can simplify development workflows.

5. **Using Hygen eliminates the need for understanding the underlying code structure**:
   - *Reality*: Code generators like **Hygen** assist in scaffolding, but a deep understanding of the codebase and architecture is crucial for effective development and maintenance.

## Overview

Building a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application involves setting up both the backend and frontend, managing state, and ensuring smooth interactions between different parts of the application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate **Express.js** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, **Redux** for state management, and **Hygen** for automating boilerplate code generation.

## Project Structure

Organizing your project structure effectively is crucial for scalability and maintainability. Here's a combined structure for both backend and frontend:

project/ backend/ app/ routes.js handlers/ createItem.js readItems.js updateItem.js deleteItem.js models/ item.js config/ db.js server.js frontend/ src/ components/ ItemList.js ItemForm.js modules/ boot.js items/ index.js view.js state.js App.js index.js _templates/ route/ new/ handler.ejs.t inject_handler.ejs.t module/ new/ index.ejs.t view.ejs.t state.ejs.t inject_boot.ejs.t

arduino


- **backend/**: Contains the Express.js server and related backend code.
- **frontend/**: Houses the React application along with Redux state management.
- **_templates/**: Hygen templates for generating boilerplate code.

## Setting Up the Backend with Express.js

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install necessary packages:

```bash
cd project/backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose hygen
Connecting to the Database
In backend/config/db.js:

javascript

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdb', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log('MongoDB Connected');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
Defining the Item Model
In backend/models/item.js:

javascript

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const ItemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Item', ItemSchema);
Creating Handlers
Each CRUD operation has its own handler.

Create Item
backend/app/handlers/createItem.js:

javascript

const Item = require('../../models/item');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newItem = new Item(req.body);
    const item = await newItem.save();
    res.status(201).json(item);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
Read Items
backend/app/handlers/readItems.js:

javascript

const Item = require('../../models/item');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const items = await Item.find();
    res.json(items);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
Update Item
backend/app/handlers/updateItem.js:

javascript

const Item = require('../../models/item');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const updatedItem = await Item.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true });
    res.json(updatedItem);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
Delete Item
backend/app/handlers/deleteItem.js:

javascript

const Item = require('../../models/item');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await Item.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
    res.json({ message: 'Item deleted' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
Defining Routes
In backend/app/routes.js:

javascript

const express = require('express');
const createItem = require('./handlers/createItem');
const readItems = require('./handlers/readItems');
const updateItem = require('./handlers/updateItem');
const deleteItem = require('./handlers/deleteItem');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/items', createItem);
router.get('/items', readItems);
router.put('/items/:id', updateItem);
router.delete('/items/:id', deleteItem);

module.exports = router;
Setting Up the Server
In backend/server.js:

javascript

const express = require('express');
const connectDB = require('./config/db');
const routes = require('./app/routes');

const app = express();

// Connect Database
connectDB();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// Use Routes
app.use('/api', routes);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}`));
Setting Up the Frontend with React
Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and set up a React application:

bash

cd project/frontend
npx create-react-app .
npm install redux react-redux hygen axios
Project Structure
css

frontend/
  src/
    components/
      ItemList.js
      ItemForm.js
    modules/
      boot.js
      items/
        index.js
        view.js
        state.js
    App.js
    index.js
Bootstrapping Redux
In frontend/src/modules/boot.js:

javascript

import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import itemsReducer from './items/state';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  items: itemsReducer,
  // Add more reducers here
});

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk))
);

export default store;
In frontend/src/index.js:

javascript

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './modules/boot';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
Creating Components
ItemList.js
frontend/src/components/ItemList.js:

javascript

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchItems, deleteItem } from '../modules/items/state';

const ItemList = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { items, loading, error } = useSelector(state => state.items);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchItems());
  }, [dispatch]);

  const handleDelete = (id) => {
    dispatch(deleteItem(id));
  };

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item._id}>
          <strong>{item.name}</strong>: {item.description}
          <button onClick={() => handleDelete(item._id)}>Delete</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default ItemList;
ItemForm.js
frontend/src/components/ItemForm.js:

javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { createItem } from '../modules/items/state';

const ItemForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (name.trim() === '') return;
    dispatch(createItem({ name, description }));
    setName('');
    setDescription('');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        placeholder="Name" 
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} 
        required 
      />
      <input 
        type="text" 
        placeholder="Description" 
        value={description}
        onChange={e => setDescription(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <button type="submit">Add Item</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ItemForm;
Managing State with Redux
In frontend/src/modules/items/state.js:

javascript

import axios from 'axios';

// Initial State
const initialState = {
  items: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
};

// Action Types
const FETCH_ITEMS_REQUEST = 'items/FETCH_ITEMS_REQUEST';
const FETCH_ITEMS_SUCCESS = 'items/FETCH_ITEMS_SUCCESS';
const FETCH_ITEMS_FAILURE = 'items/FETCH_ITEMS_FAILURE';
const CREATE_ITEM_SUCCESS = 'items/CREATE_ITEM_SUCCESS';
const DELETE_ITEM_SUCCESS = 'items/DELETE_ITEM_SUCCESS';

// Reducer
export default function itemsReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_ITEMS_REQUEST:
      return { ...state, loading: true, error: null };
    case FETCH_ITEMS_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, loading: false, items: action.payload };
    case FETCH_ITEMS_FAILURE:
      return { ...state, loading: false, error: action.payload };
    case CREATE_ITEM_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] };
    case DELETE_ITEM_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(item => item._id !== action.payload) };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Action Creators
export const fetchItems = () => async dispatch => {
  dispatch({ type: FETCH_ITEMS_REQUEST });
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/api/items');
    dispatch({ type: FETCH_ITEMS_SUCCESS, payload: response.data });
  } catch (error) {
    dispatch({ type: FETCH_ITEMS_FAILURE, payload: error.message });
  }
};

export const createItem = (itemData) => async dispatch => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/items', itemData);
    dispatch({ type: CREATE_ITEM_SUCCESS, payload: response.data });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error appropriately
    console.error(error);
  }
};

export const deleteItem = (id) => async dispatch => {
  try {
    await axios.delete(`/api/items/${id}`);
    dispatch({ type: DELETE_ITEM_SUCCESS, payload: id });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error appropriately
    console.error(error);
  }
};
App Component
In frontend/src/App.js:

javascript

import React from 'react';
import ItemList from './components/ItemList';
import ItemForm from './components/ItemForm';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>CRUD Application</h1>
    <ItemForm />
    <ItemList />
  </div>
);

export default App;
Automating with Hygen
Hygen can be used to automate the creation of routes and Redux modules, minimizing boilerplate and ensuring consistency across the codebase.

Setting Up Hygen Templates
Organize your Hygen templates as follows:

arduino

_templates/
  route/
    new/
      handler.ejs.t
      inject_handler.ejs.t
  module/
    new/
      index.ejs.t
      view.ejs.t
      state.ejs.t
      inject_boot.ejs.t
Creating a New Route
To generate a new route, use the following command:

bash

$ hygen route new --method post --name auth
inject_handler.ejs.t
ejs

---
inject: true
to: backend/app/routes.js
skip_if: <%= name %>
before: "module.exports = router"
---
router.<%= method %>('/<%= name %>', <%= name %>);
This template injects the new route into backend/app/routes.js before the module is exported.

Creating a New Module
To generate a new Redux module, use:

bash

$ hygen module new --name settings
inject_boot.ejs.t
ejs

---
to: frontend/src/modules/boot.js
inject: true
skip_if: <%= name %>
after: "const rootReducer = combineReducers({"
---
  <%= name %>: require('./<%= name %>/state').default,
This injects the new module's reducer into boot.js after the combineReducers call.

Implementing CRUD Operations
Let's walk through implementing a complete CRUD cycle: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Create
Backend: The createItem handler in backend/app/handlers/createItem.js handles item creation.
Frontend: The ItemForm component in frontend/src/components/ItemForm.js allows users to input new items.
Redux: The createItem action in frontend/src/modules/items/state.js dispatches the creation action, updating the state upon successful creation.
Read
Backend: The readItems handler in backend/app/handlers/readItems.js fetches all items.
Frontend: The ItemList component in frontend/src/components/ItemList.js displays the list of items.
Redux: The fetchItems action in frontend/src/modules/items/state.js retrieves items from the backend and updates the state.
Update
Backend: The updateItem handler in backend/app/handlers/updateItem.js updates an existing item.
Frontend: You can create an ItemEdit component to handle editing items (similar to ItemForm).
Redux: Implement an updateItem action in the Redux state to handle updates.
Delete
Backend: The deleteItem handler in backend/app/handlers/deleteItem.js removes an item.
Frontend: Add a delete button in the ItemList component to allow users to delete items.
Redux: The deleteItem action in frontend/src/modules/items/state.js dispatches the deletion action and updates the state.
Best Practices
Modular Architecture: Separate concerns by organizing code into modules, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
Automated Code Generation: Utilize Hygen to generate boilerplate code, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
Atomic Notes: Structure documentation so that each module or component has a single responsibility, facilitating clarity and testability.
Backlinking: Connect related concepts and modules within your documentation for easy navigation and reference.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling both on the backend and frontend to ensure a robust application.
Security: Ensure that your backend routes are secured and validate all incoming data to prevent vulnerabilities.

# Hygen Templates for Building a Full CRUD Application with Express, React, Redux

Automating repetitive tasks is crucial for maintaining consistency and efficiency in a full-stack application. **Hygen** provides a robust solution for generating boilerplate code through customizable templates. This guide focuses exclusively on the Hygen templates used to scaffold a CRUD application integrated with **Express.js**, **React**, and **Redux**.

## Common Misconceptions

Before delving into the templates, it's important to clarify some common misconceptions about Hygen and the technologies involved:

1. **Hygen Replaces Developer Understanding**:
   - *Reality*: Hygen automates boilerplate code generation but does not replace the need for developers to understand the underlying architecture and code structure.

2. **Hygen is Limited to Frontend Development**:
   - *Reality*: Hygen can be effectively used for both frontend and backend code generation, enhancing productivity across the entire stack.

3. **Templates are One-Size-Fits-All**:
   - *Reality*: Hygen templates are highly customizable and can be tailored to fit the specific architectural patterns and coding standards of a project.

4. **Hygen Automatically Handles Complex Logic**:
   - *Reality*: While Hygen can generate the scaffolding, implementing complex business logic still requires manual coding and developer insight.

5. **Using Hygen Means Less Code Maintenance**:
   - *Reality*: Hygen helps in maintaining consistency but does not eliminate the need for regular code maintenance and refactoring.

## Template Structure

Organizing Hygen templates effectively is essential for seamless code generation. Below is the structure of the Hygen templates used for the CRUD application:

_templates/ route/ new/ handler.ejs.t inject_handler.ejs.t module/ new/ index.ejs.t view.ejs.t state.ejs.t inject_boot.ejs.t

vbnet


- **route/new/**: Templates for creating new Express.js routes.
  - `handler.ejs.t`: Template for route handlers.
  - `inject_handler.ejs.t`: Template to inject new routes into the routes file.

- **module/new/**: Templates for creating new Redux modules.
  - `index.ejs.t`: Template for the module's index file.
  - `view.ejs.t`: Template for React components associated with the module.
  - `state.ejs.t`: Template for Redux state management.
  - `inject_boot.ejs.t`: Template to inject the new module into the Redux store.

## Template Files

### 1. Route Templates

const <%= capitalize(name) %> = require('../../models/<%= name %>');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Implement <%= capitalize(name) %> logic here
    res.status(200).json({ message: '<%= capitalize(name) %> handler executed successfully.' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
Purpose: Creates a new handler file for the specified route.
Path: backend/app/handlers/
Usage: Automatically handles HTTP requests for a specific route.

      <h2><%= capitalize(name) %> List</h2>
      <ul>
        {<%= name %>s.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

Purpose: Adds the new module's reducer to the root reducer.
Injection Point: After the combineReducers({ line.
Usage: Integrates the new module into the Redux store.
Using the Templates
Hygen templates streamline the process of adding new routes and modules. Here's how to utilize them effectively:

1. Generating a New Route
To create a new Express.js route with its handler:

bash

$ hygen route new --method post --name auth
Parameters:

--method: HTTP method (e.g., get, post, put, delete).
--name: Name of the route (e.g., auth, login, register).
What Happens:

Generates a new handler file in backend/app/handlers/.
Injects the new route into backend/app/routes.js.
2. Generating a New Redux Module
To create a new Redux module with its components:

bash

$ hygen module new --name user
Parameters:

--name: Name of the module (e.g., user, product, order).
What Happens:

Generates index.js, view.js, and state.js in frontend/src/modules/user/.
Injects the new module's reducer into frontend/src/modules/boot.js.
Advantages of Using Hygen Templates
Consistency: Ensures that all routes and modules follow the same structure and conventions.
Efficiency: Reduces the time spent on writing repetitive boilerplate code.
Scalability: Simplifies the process of adding new features as the application grows.
Maintainability: Makes the codebase easier to manage by enforcing a standardized structure.
Best Practices
Customize Templates: Tailor Hygen templates to match your project's specific needs and coding standards.
Version Control Templates: Keep your templates under version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.
Regularly Update Templates: As your project evolves, update your templates to incorporate new patterns and practices.
Document Template Usage: Maintain clear documentation on how to use and modify templates to ensure team-wide understanding.

# Comprehensive Hygen Templates for a Full-Stack CRUD Application with Express, React, Redux

Building a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application requires a well-structured approach to both the backend and frontend components. **Hygen** facilitates this process by automating the generation of boilerplate code through customizable templates. This guide outlines the necessary requirements for a full-stack CRUD application and provides comprehensive Hygen templates to cover all aspects, including forms and additional functionalities.

## Requirements for a Full-Stack CRUD Application

To ensure a complete and functional CRUD application, the following components and functionalities must be addressed:

### Backend (Express.js)

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Connection setup (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose).

2. **Data Models**
   - Define schemas and models for the data entities.

3. **Route Handlers**
   - Handlers for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

4. **Routes Definition**
   - Define API endpoints and bind them to respective handlers.

5. **Middleware**
   - Error handling, authentication, validation, etc.

6. **Server Initialization**
   - Setup Express server and connect all components.

### Frontend (React & Redux)

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organized directories for components, modules, and utilities.

2. **State Management**
   - Redux setup with actions, reducers, and store configuration.

3. **React Components**
   - Components for listing items, creating new items, editing existing items, and deleting items.

4. **Forms**
   - Reusable form components for Create and Update operations.

5. **API Integration**
   - Services or utilities for making HTTP requests to the backend.

6. **Routing**
   - Client-side routing to navigate between different views.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Displaying error messages and handling failed operations gracefully.

8. **Styling**
   - Consistent styling across components (CSS, SASS, styled-components, etc.).

### Automation (Hygen)

1. **Templates for Backend**
   - Handlers, routes, and models.

2. **Templates for Frontend**
   - Redux modules, React components, and forms.

3. **Injection Templates**
   - Automatically inject new routes and Redux modules into existing configuration files.

Using the Templates
Hygen templates streamline the process of adding new routes, handlers, models, Redux modules, and React components. Here's how to utilize them effectively:

1. Generating a New Backend Model
To create a new Mongoose model:

bash

$ hygen model new --name product
Parameters:

--name: Name of the model (e.g., product, user, order).
What Happens:

Generates a new model file in backend/models/.
2. Generating a New Backend Handler and Route
To create CRUD handlers and routes for a new entity:

bash

$ hygen handler new --name product
$ hygen route new --name product --method post
Parameters:

--name: Name of the entity (e.g., product, user).
--method: HTTP methods as needed (e.g., post, get, put, delete).
What Happens:

Generates handler methods in backend/app/handlers/.
Defines routes in backend/app/routes/.
Injects handlers and routes into respective configuration files.
3. Generating a New Redux Module
To create a Redux module for state management:

bash

$ hygen module new --name product
Parameters:

--name: Name of the module (e.g., product, user).
What Happens:

Generates actions.js, reducer.js, and index.js in frontend/src/modules/product/.
Injects the new reducer into the Redux store configuration.
4. Generating React Components
To create React components for listing and managing items:

bash

$ hygen component new --name productList
$ hygen component new --name productForm
$ hygen component new --name productEditForm
Parameters:

--name: Name of the component (e.g., productList, productForm).
What Happens:

Generates ProductList.js, ProductForm.js, and ProductEditForm.js in frontend/src/components/.
These components are ready to be integrated into the application.
5. Generating API Services
To create an API service for handling HTTP requests:

bash

$ hygen service new --name product
Parameters:

--name: Name of the service (e.g., product, user).
What Happens:

Generates productApi.js in frontend/src/services/.
Centralizes API calls for the specified entity.

You said:
hey everybody welcome back to a new
video on this channel and today we have
a look into BFF best friends forever yes
of course but let's see what BFF means
in the context of app development and
how to use that pattern right after the
intro let's
[Music]
go in last week's video we talked a lot
about using KNX with different backends
Last weeks video
which more or less meant using different
backends like hono Express and fastify
in the nodejs or like JavaScript
environment and then use h3's
compatibility layer to use them inside
knjs and lots of people said like hey
yeah that's great but I don't have like
a JavaScript back end I don't have
something I can integrate into KN so
External APIs make sense
instead I use something like d Jango or
laravel or spring boot or maybe some
bunch of third party apis as well which
is totally valid I mean you don't have
to write everything in JavaScript anyway
right if you have something that needs
hyper performance and machine learning
then maybe another language might be a
really good idea or your backend team
your dedicated backend team is just more
proficient in that so no problem with
that but let's see what the BFF part
means and how we can still improve the
usage of external like backend services
or third party apis in nox and with
Nitro so once again BFF yes best friends
What does BFF mean?
forever like KNX and you are of course
obviously but in this video it's more
about the backend for frontend
architectural pattern and now you might
wonder wait wait wait wait Alex back end
for front end like we we have a backend
and we have a front end so why do we
need anything in between let's have a
look commonly you have exactly that
setup a front end and a general back end
that serves all the data for the front
end but what if for example multiple
applications quarrying that back end and
of course your back end team doesn't
want to build routes for every single of
these applications to cater their needs
so let's say we have a front end and
that front end only needs a user's ID
username birth data and email but of
course the back end gives all the things
like tons of other unnecessary data
which kind of makes sense because in
other calls you might need them so now
you could start and say okay yeah we
have routes we have filters we have
things to improve that on the one hand
this increases the strain on your
backend team plus it's always a question
whether the back end should really focus
on what data needs to be served then
applying a general way of fetching data
and their needs and this is where the
back and for front and comes in right so
we really need something here in the
middle especially if we don't only have
a backend but maybe also data from other
services like headless CMS thirdparty
apis and maybe we can't even control the
back end at all and say hey this is the
data that we get that's it we have to do
the manipulation and transformation on
our own so let's see how it works with a
back end for front end and then how to
implement it with no Nitro and if we
move from this schematic all the way
over to the back and for front and one
you'll see okay there's not that much
happening except that the front end is
now calling the BFF the BFF is calling
the back end the back end is returning
data to BFF and the back end for front
end is returning the data to the front
end and in here the data transformation
will happen so we strip all the
unnecessary content
Benefits of a BFF
now you might say yeah come on for these
few Fields sure I get you but I've seen
projects where you have really like
kilobytes probably sometimes even
megabytes of data uh that you don't
really want to send at all because for
some requests you might just need a list
of names for example to preview some
articles or to yeah have a simple list
overview page and this is where the BFF
is really shining so if your general
backend doesn't allow that to do or
maybe you want to do some things on top
of it like caching for example right or
say oh yeah I have to enrich the data
with data from other apis then we really
need that kind of back end for front end
because you also don't necessarily want
to integrate all the third-party apis in
your general backend because if you want
to switch out a service well then you
have to do it for all the applications
and it will also increase the strain on
your back end while if you say oh yeah
in this case we want to use another
let's say image provider then why not
switching that out in the BFF that is
bound to your application and not the
back end so yeah this is definitely
something we can do and the best part is
we can just imagine the backend our case
as not under our control that makes
things a bit easier just saying like hey
dear backend Engineers can we Implement
that and then we have some big back and
forth um sometimes it's also totally
useful don't get me wrong but if we have
all the data in a way or another then we
can also fetch them so let's see what we
can do in knon Nitro to more or less
make the whole thing happen I will also
refer to some of the videos for example
about caching in Nitro and so on so on
so if you haven't seen these definitely
take a look in some more in-depth
content but let's get started all right
Setup of our Demo Application
folks our demo application is as minimal
as usual as you know already so we have
the compatibility date set I also made a
video if you don't know about that but
don't worry it won't do much for now we
have that little background color so it
will be dark in the background and white
text and then we have our future
compatibility version 4 to opt into the
KNX 4 break making changes whenever they
will be released as next 4 you're
already prepared also made a video about
that link in the description and then we
have an app app. view so we use the new
app folder the structure from Next 4 and
then in our app. view we just say we
have a user we fetch it from the very
simple Json placeholder typic cod.com
API and then we show the content and if
we go to the browser then this will look
like this okay nothing crazy so far
right we fetched some data and we're
good but what if we want to do more like
we said in the example maybe we just
want to strip everything except these
fields ID name username email so we want
to get rid of the rest because just
Remove data in the front end only?
imagine having a big user object not
only with these data but maybe with like
attach comments and this and that and
this will all be fetched by the back end
of course that's not really what we want
so maybe let's remove them and of course
now we could start saying yeah but you
can just do that in the front end you
can just say take the user object delete
the fields or like the structur it or
whatever and you're good but the problem
there is that then the data will still
be transmitted through wire which means
slower page speed right like we need to
S like get lots of data that we don't
even need and especially the bigger the
data the harder the thing is I've
already shown how to solve the problem
with use Fetch and use Asing data with
the transform function which we can just
showcase here real quick and then see
why this is the solution only half way
through and we might still need a BFF so
as mentioned we can use the transform
function here and say okay we have some
input we don't know what it is and then
we just say like okay you know what id
is input. ID can just type it as any
here for now um and then we had the uh
name is input name the same thing with
uh the username is also input the
username and last but not least we
wanted the email which is input email
and if we now eventually switch back to
the browser we'll see okay this is gone
that's great perfect the issue is like
sure if we take a look at the page
Source it's also only in there right
that works fine but if we now say okay
we would navigate on the client side
from A to B like the first request of
course happens on the server side so not
too much data is sent but if we then do
a client side request then we have the
data again because the original API will
be queried and no matter how you
transform your data it's still too much
because you can't just say hey API give
me less we're it's not under our control
in this example so instead we want to
Moving the transformation to the BFF
move the whole transformation over to
our back end for front end which we'll
build right now with Nitro and H3 in our
nox application also this of course can
be a standalone service you don't have
to bake it into KN and also if you use
something else you use Plain View feel
free to just spin up an Nitro server and
do the same but with NX it's a little
bit easier due to well end to end type
safety for example so let's get started
first of course we want to create a
server folder and in here we have a new
API and let's say we called users
similar to our uh example here and then
we have an ID and it's a typescript file
of course so then we create an event
handler uh and more or less we can copy
the code from here because we still have
to f fetch the original API right so we
what we want to do is we always want to
fetch that API but of course we can't
use transform here that's only for use
fetch uh and use Asing data so we have
const result is await the whole call and
now we can just say like okay we return
more or less uh what we did before here
and instead of input well we just say um
result and now of course also yes this
is unknown by default so we can just
type it as end
or you know what let's just do a record
string any and that will solve most of
the issues around that that's also fine
um and now we know okay things are in
there we can have way nicer types but
that's um that's for later of course so
one more thing we want to do is we want
to get the ID so it's say okay we want
to use get router pram here we say pass
in the event and get the ID if there is
no ID or if it's zero then we just throw
a new error created by create error just
saying uh all right no ID supplied uh
provided might be easier and then we of
course have the status code which is um
400 that's fine okay now we want to
insert that ID here and let's see if we
now call the whole thing if we now call
oops if we now call the whole um API
what it will return for that we move
back in the browser and we just use API
users one and here we see that's exactly
what we need right that's exactly the
data that was also shown here in our
page now the only thing it's left to do
is we actually have to call that API in
our very own application so to do this
we go into our app here and then we say
Okay instead of the whole code here we
can just say use fetch API users ID and
the best part is just say one here for
example this already gives us the
wonderful types safety even though we
don't have many types here um it will
eventually still help us when we have
them in place so that seems pretty good
let's see if it works let's go back to
the browser and go to our application
refresh it and it still works as it
should lovely okay so far so good now
Unlocked possibilities
this doesn't seem like a huge
Improvement but the best part is now we
can do a lot of things with that data so
first of all we can cach it which we'll
do next and then why not show all the
users that have been accessed like the
last I don't know two three four five
users uh throughout the whole page so if
someone clicks on a user well then uh
that user will be saved in some kind of
storage and all the other people on the
index page they will see oh yeah these
are the the users that were recently
shown this is kind of an inspirational
feature from a project I've worked on
already uh which basically looks like uh
looks like this so here we also have
like recently searched people and if I
search for more people they will just be
added here and I think that's pretty
helpful the best part is also here I
used the back end for front end mainly
because the data was not really under
our control um so yeah let's let's go
ahead with the caching and then with the
recent users and um last but not least
we can also show a few more tricks here
and there so let's get started the
Using BFF for Caching
caching part is quite interesting uh
I've also made a video about that
caching in Nitro and once again you
could think oh yeah we just use theine
cache demand Handler here but I would
suggest not to mainly because we also
want to implement the recent users
functionality soon so we rather don't
want to catch the whole API in point
because we still want to register
whether or not a user was requested
instead we could just say okay let's
create a function that is caching the
whole API call and the transformation so
basically this part here should be
cached and we can do that of course in
the same file but let's just say we have
server UTS users. TS and then in here we
could say export const uh get user then
this is uh a defined cached a defined
cached function and eventually we have
the ID here which can be a
string and eventually we want to do all
the things in here so let's just quickly
get this whole code over here paste it
in and this is already looking pretty
okay if we need an async to make sure
the await works we have this part in
place great one more thing to suggest
it's always nice to also provide the H3
event especially if you deploy at some
point at the edge because um let's
quickly import that here H3 went from H3
because if you for example use club for
workers I think that's even a better
example then you really want to make
sure that these are waiting for all the
calls that might happen and don't have
any dangling promises so uh with theine
cach function you can make sure that's
the case and even we don't need the
event here at all we can just provide it
and will still be considered and then
event at wait until will be called but
that's just as a tiny hit so we have to
get user function now and instead of
calling what we had here before we can
just use get user instead of the code
that we had back here we can just write
get user and then pass in the ID that we
have here we await it and say const user
is get user
wonderful we also need the event of
course that's what we passed in before
and from here we can even say okay later
on to do um make sure the user is added
as recent and then we're fine and of
course we want to return the user still
otherwise things might break okay so
last but not least we want to set up our
cached function because we have it here
but now we can say let's disable S SWR
and have a Max a age of I don't know 10
or just say like straight away um yeah
let's let's do max age of it doesn't
matter much because the data is stale
anyway like it's it's not changing so we
can do that can even leave SWR on for
that example um and if you don't know
what all of these is definitely check
out the cashing uh in in Nitro video uh
where explained all these in Deb so if
we just open the da tools and refresh
the page then we'll see wow 8
milliseconds response time that's pretty
decent that's rather clear that there is
a cach behind because in 8 milliseconds
you can't do any API call so we simply
decided to cach the data from our back
end without them being involved at all
it's all cach and also not for only for
the application if you are in another
application carying the same back end
well you can Define your own cach times
or even if you have a different route
and so on so on so you're fully
autonomous in your decision what to cash
Do more with the data
and for how long now last but least
let's implement the recent users thing
and then we're good to go with a very
simple example of back for front end and
for the recent users we still start once
again in our users. Ts for the UIL and
we have an export const here saying or
maybe let's just make a function
straight away get recent users so
somehow we want to get them right it is
probably async so we need this for sure
and then we also have an export async
function uh
that uh adds uh recent
user and then we need the user data here
so we say user user user we don't have a
type for that yet maybe time to finally
type things so say type user is ID
string name String username string and
email string what a surprise here
because we don't have any types here we
can just say as user and then we're fine
and in here we want to return a promise
with the
users and eventually here we can decide
uh to either ignore that and just say
okay this is void right this is also
fine or we say you know what um we want
to get the new users as well after
adding them so we can even say here okay
promise user that's really up to the
implementation detail but of course
nothing is in here so far so let's
improve that okay so first of all we
want to get all the users so let's say
const users or let's say const current
users equals um get users of
course get maybe get recent users is a
bit better
um we want to await the whole thing as
it async and then we have the users in
theory we also want to set uh a user
let's say recent user limit and we can
set it to three so now what we can do is
we want to actually add the user to the
array and eventually if the whole array
is too long well then we just decide to
uh remove the the last one so what we
can do is we can say current users do
push um you can also unshift it it
doesn't matter if it's the the front or
the end it's yeah it doesn't matter much
we can let's just do unshift for here
that's fine we add the user in here now
we say if current users length if it's
greater than the recent user limit well
then of course we want to make sure to
say current users. pop remove the last
one that was added to the list and we're
good and now we have to save the users
again so this this is will be a little
to do for us and same idea we can just
then say return current users uh and
then we fulfilled the contract we set up
with the types so how do we save the
users and how do we get the things well
this we'll figure out now first we need
a key for uh wherever this is stored so
we just say resend users that's fine and
now we use nitro's uh integration with
un storage so we use un storage under
the hood and the use storage function in
night also made a video about that link
in the description as usual so we'll
briefly go through that more details are
in the mentioned video and the first
thing we want to do is of course we want
to say const users equals use
storage then we can Define name here if
we want to um but we can just leave the
default for now get items or in this
case just get item uh we use the key we
just want this one item which is an
array saved in there uh and in here we
want to aade it as well and then just
say return users so now we also want to
make sure it is of the right type so we
don't want to type it key but we want to
type it
user and then we're good to go the only
thing is it could be null that's true so
worst worst case we just do this and
we're fine so in case this can't be
retrieved for whatever reason we just
make sure it will be an empty array and
now we can get the whole thing perfect
so last but not least we want to save
the users so to save the users we just
say a wait we use also use storage once
again and we want to say set item in the
same scenario with the same key and the
values will be current users so also
here we don't even need to type it
because of course it will be inferred by
the current users that I provided here
so then we save the users let's even
keep the comment I think it's pretty
nice and then we're good now the only
thing is we need to implement it somehow
right we need to call these things
somewhere so what we can now do is in
our idts here we know what kind of user
will be fetched so there we what we have
to do we can just say okay you know what
add user or add recent
user and then we just call uh this with
user we await it and we're good to go so
this will make sure that all users that
are fetched will be saved as recent
users users until uh there are three in
there then the the first one will be
removed and last but not least we
actually want to make sure this is also
possible to show in our application so
we need an API in point to show it and
we need to be able to fetch different
users so that's cool let's start with
Additional API endpoint
the API in point so instead of API uh
users idts we can just say uh API users
info resent for example and in here
that's also an event handler and we just
return
uh get uh recent users and that's all we
need to do luckily because we nicely
extracted it already so what we can do
as a test already is we can go back to
the browser in here we can refresh that
page and now we can say users info
recent and see if it's in there or not
and the answer is it is in there so if
we refresh this page a couple times and
then go back we see on resent user one
two and three all the same okay if we
now would say let's just take users two
and users five in here and now we go
back to info recent well then they're in
here as well perfect so our assignment
is kind of done now we just have to do
Front end logic
the front end part to make sure it's
changeable and then we're good to go so
let's get going to implement it I would
just say we do very very simple
variation of the whole thing we just say
we have a constant number here it's a
ref right we just start with a zero here
um then we have this wonderful use fetch
function where we say okay this will be
uh an A G function then could also be
computed that's also fine and in here we
want to use
number value uh we can move into a
template string to make it look a bit
nicer that's never hurts and now we want
to change that number based on well uh
whenever something changes so we could
just say let's have some buttons here uh
button V4 for n in five uh and then say
fetch user
n and add click we just say number
equals n and now you might wonder if
this actually works because it it looks
like black magic a little bit but yes it
does and also this was covered in our
use Asing data versus use fetch video so
let's have a look in the browser and see
if this is doing what it should and I
admit the buttons are not nice I'm not a
UI designer right and not not the point
of the video so if you click it it will
just magically work because use fetch is
watching The Ref and we're good and last
but not least what we also want to do is
refetch the data now whenever we change
something to see the recent users so
back to the code how do we do that well
we can just say we have another const uh
data recent users here and we say await
use fetch uh and then we just
say slash
API uses INF for recent and in here we
could uh just trigger the
watch and we watch user so in every user
changes recent users will also be
retched and now what we could do we
could uh do a UL in Li V4 maybe in h2v
before resend
users user in users uh users and recent
users and then we
just say user.name
here and maybe user. ID and then we're
good so let's see if this works and try
it out in the browser and here we are
clicking around and seeing things will
change and two is in 4 three one is out
five five okay multiple clicking on five
doesn't work because it doesn't refresh
the data that's also fine uh we could
even have a trigger if we want to but
that's okay because data is already
there why should we and this could also
be radio buttons instead of just buttons
of course semantic HTML would be better
Summary
but I think for the demo that's
sufficient and here we are we
implemented a little back and for front
and with some own functionality without
bothering any back and Def um it's fast
due to the caching it's all super close
we have the type safety and we're good
to go I think this is a very nice
capability of what KNX together with H3
un storage Nitro and all the tools
around can do within yeah just a couple
minutes any questions let me know in the
comments please uh always always I
always check them out and answer I'm
back from vacation now so the videos we
seen were record a little bit ahead um
maybe seen the 10 I'm just kidding
anyway uh let me know if there's any
questions and uh next week next Friday
next video you got it talk to you soon
folks and happy hacking

Form
GitHub
Collect and validate form data.
Usage
Use the Form component to validate form data using schema libraries such as Yup, Zod, Joi, Valibot, or your own validation logic.

It works with the FormGroup component to display error messages around form elements automatically.

The form component requires two props:

state - a reactive object holding the form's state.
schema - a schema object from a validation library like Yup, Zod, Joi or Valibot.
Note that no validation library is included by default, so ensure you install the one you need.

Yup

Zod

Joi

Valibot
Email
Password
Submit

<script setup lang="ts">
import { object, string, type InferType } from 'yup'
import type { FormSubmitEvent } from '#ui/types'

const schema = object({
  email: string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
  password: string()
    .min(8, 'Must be at least 8 characters')
    .required('Required')
})

type Schema = InferType<typeof schema>

const state = reactive({
  email: undefined,
  password: undefined
})

async function onSubmit (event: FormSubmitEvent<Schema>) {
  // Do something with event.data
  console.log(event.data)
}
</script>

<template>
  <UForm :schema="schema" :state="state" class="space-y-4" @submit="onSubmit">
    <UFormGroup label="Email" name="email">
      <UInput v-model="state.email" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UFormGroup label="Password" name="password">
      <UInput v-model="state.password" type="password" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UButton type="submit">
      Submit
    </UButton>
  </UForm>
</template>
Custom validation
Use the validate prop to apply your own validation logic.

The validation function must return a list of errors with the following attributes:

message - Error message for display.
path - Path to the form element corresponding to the name attribute.
Note that it can be used alongside the schema prop to handle complex use cases.
Email
Password
Submit

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { FormError, FormSubmitEvent } from '#ui/types'

const state = reactive({
  email: undefined,
  password: undefined
})

const validate = (state: any): FormError[] => {
  const errors = []
  if (!state.email) errors.push({ path: 'email', message: 'Required' })
  if (!state.password) errors.push({ path: 'password', message: 'Required' })
  return errors
}

async function onSubmit (event: FormSubmitEvent<any>) {
  // Do something with data
  console.log(event.data)
}
</script>

<template>
  <UForm :validate="validate" :state="state" class="space-y-4" @submit="onSubmit">
    <UFormGroup label="Email" name="email">
      <UInput v-model="state.email" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UFormGroup label="Password" name="password">
      <UInput v-model="state.password" type="password" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UButton type="submit">
      Submit
    </UButton>
  </UForm>
</template>
This can also be used to integrate with other validation libraries. Here is an example with Vuelidate:


<script setup lang="ts">
import useVuelidate from '@vuelidate/core'

const props = defineProps({
  rules: { type: Object, required: true },
  model: { type: Object, required: true }
})

const form = ref();
const v = useVuelidate(props.rules, props.model)

async function validateWithVuelidate() {
  v.value.$touch()
  await v.value.$validate()
  return v.value.$errors.map((error) => ({
    message: error.$message,
    path: error.$propertyPath,
  }))
}

defineExpose({
  validate: async () => {
    await form.value.validate()
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <UForm ref="form" :state="model" :validate="validateWithVuelidate">
    <slot />
  </UForm>
</template>
Backend validation
You can manually set errors after form submission if required. To do this, simply use the form.setErrors function to set the errors as needed.


<script setup lang="ts">
import type { FormError, FormSubmitEvent } from '#ui/types'

const state = reactive({
  email: undefined,
  password: undefined
})

const form = ref()

async function onSubmit (event: FormSubmitEvent<any>) {
  form.value.clear()
  try {
    const response = await $fetch('...')
    // ...
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.statusCode === 422) {
      form.value.setErrors(err.data.errors.map((err) => ({
        // Map validation errors to { path: string, message: string }
        message: err.message,
        path: err.path,
      })))
    }
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <UForm ref="form" :state="state" @submit="onSubmit">
    <UFormGroup label="Email" name="email">
      <UInput v-model="state.email" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UFormGroup label="Password" name="password">
      <UInput v-model="state.password" type="password" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UButton type="submit">
      Submit
    </UButton>
  </UForm>
</template>
Input events
The Form component automatically triggers validation upon submit, input, blur or change events.

This ensures that any errors are displayed as soon as the user interacts with the form elements. You can control when validation happens this using the validate-on prop.

Note that the input event is not triggered until after the initial blur event. This is to prevent the form from being validated as the user is typing. You can override this behavior by setting the eager-validation prop on FormGroup to true.

Error event
You can listen to the @error event to handle errors. This event is triggered when the form is submitted and contains an array of FormError objects with the following fields:

id - the identifier of the form element.
path - the path to the form element matching the name.
message - the error message to display.
Here's an example that focuses the first input element with an error after the form is submitted:

Email
Password
Submit

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { FormError, FormErrorEvent, FormSubmitEvent } from '#ui/types'

const state = reactive({
  email: undefined,
  password: undefined
})

const validate = (state: any): FormError[] => {
  const errors = []
  if (!state.email) errors.push({ path: 'email', message: 'Required' })
  if (!state.password) errors.push({ path: 'password', message: 'Required' })
  return errors
}

async function onSubmit (event: FormSubmitEvent<any>) {
  // Do something with data
  console.log(event.data)
}

async function onError (event: FormErrorEvent) {
  const element = document.getElementById(event.errors[0].id)
  element?.focus()
  element?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })
}
</script>

<template>
  <UForm :validate="validate" :state="state" class="space-y-4" @submit="onSubmit" @error="onError">
    <UFormGroup label="Email" name="email">
      <UInput v-model="state.email" />
    </UFormGroup>

    <UFormGroup label="Password" name="password">

FormGroup
GitHub
Display a label and additional informations around a form element.
Usage
Use the FormGroup component around an Input, Textarea, Select or a SelectMenu with a label. The <label> will automatically be associated with the form element so it gets focused on click.

label
Email
Email
you@example.com

<template>
  <UFormGroup label="Email">
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Required
Use the required prop to indicate that the form element is required.

label
Email
required
Email
you@example.com

<template>
  <UFormGroup label="Email" required>
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Description
Use the description prop to display a description below the label.

label
Email
description
We'll only use this for spam.
Email
We'll only use this for spam.

you@example.com

<template>
  <UFormGroup label="Email" description="We'll only use this for spam.">
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Hint
Use the hint prop to display a hint above the form element.

label
Email
hint
Optional
Email
Optional
you@example.com

<template>
  <UFormGroup label="Email" hint="Optional">
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Help
Use the help prop to display an help message below the form element.

label
Email
help
We will never share your email with anyone else.
Email
you@example.com
We will never share your email with anyone else.


<template>
  <UFormGroup
    label="Email"
    help="We will never share your email with anyone else."
  >
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Error
Use the error prop to display an error message below the form element.

When used together with the help prop, the error prop will take precedence.

Email
Enter email
You must enter an email


<template>
  <UFormGroup v-slot="{ error }" label="Email" :error="!email && 'You must enter an email'" help="This is a nice email!">
    <UInput v-model="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter email" :trailing-icon="error ? 'i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle-20-solid' : undefined" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const email = ref('')
</script>
The error prop will automatically set the color prop of the form element to red.
You can also use the error prop as a boolean to mark the form element as invalid.

Email
benjamincanac

<template>
  <UFormGroup label="Email" error>
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
Learn more about form validation in the Form component.
Size
Use the size prop to change the size of the label and the form element.

size

xl
Email
Optional
We'll only use this for spam.

you@example.com
We will never share your email with anyone else.


<template>
  <UFormGroup
    size="xl"
    label="Email"
    hint="Optional"
    description="We'll only use this for spam."
    help="We will never share your email with anyone else."
  >
    <UInput placeholder="you@example.com" icon="i-heroicons-envelope" />
  </UFormGroup>
</template>
This will only work with form elements that support the size prop.
Eager Validation
By default, validation is only triggered after the initial blur event. This is to prevent the form from being validated as the user is typing. You can override this behavior by setting the eager-validation prop to true

Username
Choose Username

<template>
  <UForm :schema="schema" :state="state" class="space-y-4">
    <UFormGroup label="Username" name="username" eager-validation>
      <UInput v-model="state.username" placeholder="Choose Username" />
    </UFormGroup>
  </UForm>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(10, 'Must be at least 10 characters')
})

const state = reactive({
  username: undefined
})

Nuxt.js
Master this and much more with the official video course by the author of Pinia
Using Pinia with Nuxt is easier since Nuxt takes care of a lot of things when it comes to server side rendering. For instance, you don't need to care about serialization nor XSS attacks. Pinia supports Nuxt Bridge and Nuxt 3. For bare Nuxt 2 support, see below.

Installation
bash
npx nuxi@latest module add pinia
TIP

If you're using npm, you might encounter an ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree error. In that case, add the following to your package.json:

js
"overrides": {
  "vue": "latest"
}
We supply a module to handle everything for you, you only need to add it to modules in your nuxt.config.js file:

js
// nuxt.config.js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other options
  modules: [
    // ...
    '@pinia/nuxt',
  ],
})
And that's it, use your store as usual!

Awaiting for actions in pages
As with onServerPrefetch(), you can call a store action within asyncData(). Given how useAsyncData() works, make sure to return a value. This will allow Nuxt to skip running the action on the client side and reuse the value from the server.

vue
<script setup>
const store = useStore()
// we could also extract the data, but it's already present in the store
await useAsyncData('user', () => store.fetchUser())
</script>
If your action doesn't resolve a value, you can add any non nullish value:

vue
<script setup>
const store = useStore()
await useAsyncData('user', () => store.fetchUser().then(() => true))
</script>
TIP

If you want to use a store outside of setup(), remember to pass the pinia object to useStore(). We added it to the context so you have access to it in asyncData() and fetch():

js
import { useStore } from '~/stores/myStore'

export default {
  asyncData({ $pinia }) {
    const store = useStore($pinia)
  },
}
Auto imports
By default @pinia/nuxt exposes a few auto imports:

usePinia(), which is similar to getActivePinia() but works better with Nuxt. You can add auto imports to make your life easier:
defineStore() to define stores
storeToRefs() when you need to extract individual refs from a store
acceptHMRUpdate() for hot module replacement
It also automatically imports all stores defined within your stores folder. It doesn't lookup for nested stores though. You can customize this behavior by setting the storesDirs option:

ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other options
  modules: ['@pinia/nuxt'],
  pinia: {
    storesDirs: ['./stores/**', './custom-folder/stores/**'],
  },
})
Note the folders are relative to the root of your project. If you change the srcDir option, you need to adapt the paths accordingly.

Nuxt 2 without bridge
Pinia supports Nuxt 2 until @pinia/nuxt v0.2.1. Make sure to also install @nuxtjs/composition-api alongside pinia:

bash
yarn add pinia @pinia/nuxt@0.2.1 @nuxtjs/composition-api
# or with npm
npm install pinia @pinia/nuxt@0.2.1 @nuxtjs/composition-api
We supply a module to handle everything for you, you only need to add it to buildModules in your nuxt.config.js file:

js
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  // ... other options
  buildModules: [
    // Nuxt 2 only:
    // https://composition-api.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/setup#quick-start
    '@nuxtjs/composition-api/module',
    '@pinia/nuxt',
  ],
}
TypeScript
If you are using Nuxt 2 (@pinia/nuxt < 0.3.0) with TypeScript or have a jsconfig.json, you should also add the types for context.pinia:

json
{
  "types": [
    // ...
    "@pinia/nuxt"
  ]
}
This will also ensure you have autocompletion 😉 .

Ensure each note is actionable, navigable, and optimized for both human use and AI interpretation, supporting a second-brain system.The output must strictly follow the Obsidian note format, leaving no room for external comments or text outside of the Obsidian note itself. We want a guide to CRUD with Nuxt only but the example models and endpoints should match the previous.

We are only using nuxt four no express and no vuex. Before you answer, make a list of wrong assumptions people sometimes make about the concepts included in the question. Then write the note

# Comprehensive Hygen Templates for a Full-Stack CRUD Application with Nuxt 4

Building a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using **Nuxt 4** involves orchestrating both frontend and backend functionalities seamlessly. Utilizing **Hygen** for automating boilerplate code generation enhances productivity, consistency, and maintainability. This guide outlines the requirements for a full-stack CRUD application with Nuxt 4 and provides comprehensive Hygen templates to cover all aspects, including forms and additional functionalities, aligning with the **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** architectural pattern.

## Common Misconceptions

Before delving into the implementation, it's essential to address common misconceptions that developers might have about the involved technologies and patterns:

1. **Nuxt 4 Replaces the Need for a Backend**:
   - *Reality*: **Nuxt 4** with **Nitro** facilitates server-side rendering and API route handling but doesn't inherently replace the need for a robust backend, especially for complex applications requiring dedicated services.

2. **BFF Means Adding Another Backend**:
   - *Reality*: The **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** pattern doesn't necessitate a separate backend but rather an intermediary layer tailored to the frontend's specific needs, optimizing data handling and communication.

3. **Hygen Eliminates the Need to Understand Code Structure**:
   - *Reality*: While **Hygen** automates boilerplate generation, a deep understanding of the application's architecture and codebase remains crucial for effective development and maintenance.

4. **Pinia is Just Vuex's Replacement**:
   - *Reality*: **Pinia** offers a more intuitive and modular approach to state management in Vue.js applications, providing enhanced type safety and better integration with TypeScript compared to **Vuex**.

5. **Using BFF and Hygen Leads to Over-Engineering**:
   - *Reality*: When applied appropriately, the **BFF** pattern and **Hygen** templates streamline development, reduce redundancy, and enhance scalability without introducing unnecessary complexity.

6. **All CRUD Operations Can Be Handled Uniformly**:
   - *Reality*: Different entities might require tailored CRUD operations based on business logic, validations, and integrations, necessitating customizable templates.

## Requirements for a Full-Stack CRUD Application

To build a comprehensive CRUD application with Nuxt 4, the following components and functionalities must be addressed:

### Backend (Nuxt 4 with Nitro)

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Connection setup (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose or Prisma for ORM).

2. **Data Models**
   - Define schemas and models for the data entities.

3. **API Endpoints**
   - CRUD operations implemented as Nitro server routes.

4. **Middleware**
   - Error handling, authentication, validation, etc.

5. **BFF Implementation**
   - An intermediary layer to handle data transformation, caching, and integration with third-party APIs.

### Frontend (Nuxt 4 with Pinia)

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organized directories for components, stores, and utilities.

2. **State Management**
   - **Pinia** setup with actions, getters, and state.

3. **Vue Components**
   - Components for listing items, creating new items, editing existing items, and deleting items.

4. **Forms**
   - Reusable form components for Create and Update operations with validation.

5. **API Integration**
   - Composables or services for making HTTP requests to the backend.

6. **Routing**
   - Client-side routing to navigate between different views.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Displaying error messages and handling failed operations gracefully.

8. **Styling**
   - Consistent styling across components (CSS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, etc.).

### Automation (Hygen)

1. **Templates for Backend**
   - Models and API endpoints.

2. **Templates for Frontend**
   - Pinia stores, Vue components, and forms.

3. **Injection Templates**
   - Automatically inject new routes and Pinia modules into existing configuration files.

## Hygen Template Structure

Organizing Hygen templates effectively ensures seamless code generation. Below is the structure of the Hygen templates used for the CRUD application with Nuxt 4:

_templates/ backend/ model/ new/ model.ejs.t api/ new/ handler.ejs.t inject_handler.ejs.t route.ejs.t inject_route.ejs.t frontend/ pinia/ module/ new/ store.ejs.t actions.ejs.t getters.ejs.t inject_store.ejs.t component/ new/ list.ejs.t form.ejs.t editForm.ejs.t service/ new/ api.ejs.t

Using the Templates
Hygen templates streamline the process of adding new models, API endpoints, Pinia stores, and Vue components. Here's how to utilize them effectively:

1. Generating a New Backend Model
To create a new data model:

bash

$ hygen backend model new --name user
Parameters:

--name: Name of the model (e.g., user, product).
What Happens:

Generates a new model file in backend/models/.
2. Generating a New Backend API Handler and Route
To create CRUD handlers and routes for a new entity:

bash

$ hygen backend api new --name user
Parameters:

--name: Name of the entity (e.g., user, product).
What Happens:

Generates CRUD handlers in backend/api/.
Defines API routes in backend/api/user/routes.ts.
Injects handlers and routes into respective configuration files.
3. Generating a New Pinia Store
To create a Pinia store for state management:

bash

$ hygen frontend pinia module new --name user
Parameters:

--name: Name of the module (e.g., user, product).
What Happens:

Generates user.ts in frontend/stores/.
Injects the new store into frontend/stores/index.ts.
4. Generating Vue Components
To create Vue components for listing and managing items:

bash

$ hygen frontend component new --name userList
$ hygen frontend component new --name userForm
$ hygen frontend component new --name userEditForm
Parameters:

--name: Name of the component (e.g., userList, userForm).
What Happens:

Generates UserList.vue, UserForm.vue, and UserEditForm.vue in frontend/components/.
These components are ready to be integrated into the application.
5. Generating API Services
To create an API service for handling HTTP requests:

bash

$ hygen frontend service new --name user

Composables
use[Client]
Generated fetch composable

Composables are generated for each OpenAPI client specified in the openFetch section of Nuxt config and provide a convenient wrapper around useFetch.

It has the same API as Nuxt's useFetch composable with additional path option, which is used to replace params in the pathname.


<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await usePets('/pet/{petId}', {
  path: {
    petId: 12
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ data?.name }}</h1>
</template>

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-open-fetch'],

  openFetch: {
    clients: {}
  }
})
Key	Type	Default	Description
openAPITS	OpenAPITSOptions		OpenAPI TS options
addPlugin	boolean	true	If enable default plugin to create fetch clients
Clients			
clients.[client]	OpenFetchClientOptions		Client options
clients.[client].baseURL	string		Base URL for the request.
clients.[client].headers	HeadersInit		Request headers.
clients.[client].query	SearchParameters		Adds query search params to URL
clients.[client].schema	OpenAPI3Schema		Local or remote schema file (YAML or JSON)
Client can also be configured using runtimeConfig or environment variables:

nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  openFetch: {
    clients: {
      pets: {}
    }
  },
  runtimeConfig: {
    openFetch: {

# Comprehensive Guide to Building a Full-Stack CRUD Application with Nuxt 4

Creating a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application involves orchestrating both frontend and backend functionalities seamlessly. Utilizing **Nuxt 4** with **Nitro**, **Pinia** for state management, and **Hygen** for automating boilerplate code generation streamlines the development process, ensuring consistency and scalability. This guide explores the **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** architectural pattern within Nuxt 4, detailing the setup and implementation of a full-stack CRUD application without relying on external backend frameworks like Express.js or state management libraries like Vuex.

## Common Misconceptions

Before diving into the implementation, it's crucial to address some common misconceptions about the involved technologies and architectural patterns:

1. **BFF Pattern Requires a Separate Backend Service**
   - *Reality*: The **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** pattern serves as an intermediary layer tailored to the frontend's specific needs. With **Nitro** in **Nuxt 4**, the BFF can be integrated within the same project, eliminating the need for a separate backend service.

2. **Nuxt 4 Cannot Handle API Routes**
   - *Reality*: **Nuxt 4** equipped with **Nitro** efficiently manages server-side API routes, providing capabilities akin to traditional backend frameworks without the overhead of maintaining a separate server.

3. **Hygen Eliminates the Need for Understanding Code Architecture**
   - *Reality*: While **Hygen** automates boilerplate code generation, a thorough understanding of the project's architecture and customization of templates is essential for effective development and maintenance.

4. **Pinia is Just a Drop-In Replacement for Vuex**
   - *Reality*: **Pinia** offers a more modular, type-safe, and intuitive approach to state management in Vue.js applications, providing enhanced features over **Vuex**, especially when integrated with TypeScript.

5. **Composables Automatically Handle All API Integrations**
   - *Reality*: **Composables** provide reusable logic for API interactions but require proper configuration and understanding, especially when leveraging generated fetch composables with OpenAPI clients.

6. **Using BFF with Nuxt 4 and Pinia Necessitates Complex Configuration**
   - *Reality*: With the right setup, integrating the **BFF** pattern using **Nuxt 4**, **Nitro**, and **Pinia** can streamline data handling and state management without introducing undue complexity.

## Overview

This guide walks you through building a full-stack CRUD application using **Nuxt 4**, **Nitro**, **Pinia**, and **Hygen**. It emphasizes the **BFF** architectural pattern to optimize data handling between the frontend and various backend services or third-party APIs.

## Project Structure

Organizing your project structure effectively is vital for scalability and maintainability. Here's a combined structure for both backend and frontend within a single Nuxt 4 project:

project/ backend/ models/ user.ts api/ user.ts index.ts frontend/ components/ UserList.vue UserForm.vue UserEditForm.vue composables/ useUser.ts stores/ user.ts index.ts services/ userApi.ts _templates/ backend/ model/ new/ model.ejs.t api/ new/ handler.ejs.t inject_handler.ejs.t route.ejs.t inject_route.ejs.t frontend/ pinia/ module/ new/ store.ejs.t inject_store.ejs.t component/ new/ list.ejs.t form.ejs.t editForm.ejs.t service/ new/ api.ejs.t

javascript


- **backend/**: Contains Nitro server routes and data models.
- **frontend/**: Houses Vue components, Pinia stores, composables, and API services.
- **_templates/**: Hygen templates for generating backend and frontend code.

## Setting Up the Backend with Nitro

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project root and install necessary packages:

```bash
npm install nuxt@latest @nuxtjs/tailwindcss @pinia/nuxt hygen
Ensure Nitro is included as part of Nuxt 4's core.

Defining the User Model
Create a Mongoose model for the user entity.

backend/models/user.ts:

typescript

import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
}, { timestamps: true });

export default mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
Creating API Handlers and Routes
Using Hygen templates, generate CRUD handlers and routes.

backend/api/user.ts:

typescript

import { defineEventHandler, readBody, sendError } from 'h3';
import User from '../models/user';

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const method = event.req.method;

  switch (method) {
    case 'GET':
      try {
        const users = await User.find();
        return users;
      } catch (error) {
        sendError(event, error);
      }

    case 'POST':
      try {
        const body = await readBody(event);
        const newUser = new User(body);
        const savedUser = await newUser.save();
        return savedUser;
      } catch (error) {
        sendError(event, error);
      }

    case 'PUT':
      try {
        const id = event.context.params.id;
        const body = await readBody(event);
        const updatedUser = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(id, body, { new: true });
        return updatedUser;
      } catch (error) {
        sendError(event, error);
      }

    case 'DELETE':
      try {
        const id = event.context.params.id;
        await User.findByIdAndDelete(id);
        return { message: 'User deleted successfully.' };
      } catch (error) {
        sendError(event, error);
      }

    default:
      sendError(event, new Error(`Method ${method} not allowed`));
  }
});
backend/api/index.ts:

typescript

import user from './user';

export { user };
Setting Up the Frontend with Nuxt 4 and Pinia
Configuring Pinia
Set up Pinia for state management.

frontend/stores/user.ts:

typescript

import { defineStore } from 'pinia';
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { fetchUsers, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser } from '../services/userApi';

export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', () => {
  const users = ref([]);
  const loading = ref(false);
  const error = ref(null);

  const getUsers = async () => {
    loading.value = true;
    try {
      users.value = await fetchUsers();
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    } finally {
      loading.value = false;
    }
  };

  const addUser = async (data: { name: string; username: string; email: string }) => {
    try {
      const newUser = await createUser(data);
      users.value.push(newUser);
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  const editUser = async (id: string, data: { name?: string; username?: string; email?: string }) => {
    try {
      const updated = await updateUser(id, data);
      const index = users.value.findIndex(user => user._id === id);
      if (index !== -1) {
        users.value[index] = updated;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  const removeUser = async (id: string) => {
    try {
      await deleteUser(id);
      users.value = users.value.filter(user => user._id !== id);
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  return { users, loading, error, getUsers, addUser, editUser, removeUser };
});

      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input id="username" v-model="form.username" required />
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input id="email" v-model="form.email" type="email" required />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Update User</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';
import { useRoute, useRouter } from 'vue-router';
import { use<%= capitalize(name) %>Store } from '../stores/<%= name %>';

const store = use<%= capitalize(name) %>Store();
const route = useRoute();
const router = useRouter();

const form = ref({
  name: '',
  username: '',
  email: '',
});

onMounted(async () => {
  const id = route.params.id as string;
  const user = store.users.find(user => user._id === id);
  if (user) {
    form.value = { ...user };
  } else {
    await store.getUsers();
    const fetchedUser = store.users.find(user => user._id === id);
    if (fetchedUser) {
      form.value = { ...fetchedUser };
    }
  }
});

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const id = route.params.id as string;
  await store.editUser(id, form.value);
  router.push('/');
};
</script>
Purpose: Provides a form for editing existing users.
Usage: Automates the creation of edit form components.
3. Service Template
a. API Service Template
frontend/service/new/api.ejs.t:

ejs

---
to: frontend/services/<%= name %>Api.ts
---
import { $fetch } from 'ohmyfetch';

const API_URL = '/api/<%= name %>';

export const fetch<%= capitalize(name) %>s = () => $fetch(`${API_URL}`);

export const create<%= capitalize(name) %> = (data: { name: string; username: string; email: string }) =>
  $fetch(`${API_URL}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: data,
  });

export const update<%= capitalize(name) %> = (id: string, data: { name?: string; username?: string; email?: string }) =>
  $fetch(`${API_URL}/${id}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: data,
  });

export const delete<%= capitalize(name) %> = (id: string) =>
  $fetch(`${API_URL}/${id}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
  });
Purpose: Centralizes API calls for CRUD operations using ohmyfetch.
Usage: Automates the creation of API service files.
Implementing CRUD Operations
This section demonstrates implementing CRUD operations using the generated templates and integrating them into the Nuxt 4 application.

Create
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts handles user creation.
Frontend: The UserForm.vue component allows users to input new user data.
Pinia: The addUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the creation action, updating the state upon successful creation.
Read
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts fetches all users.
Frontend: The UserList.vue component displays the list of users.
Pinia: The getUsers action in frontend/stores/user.ts retrieves users from the backend and updates the state.
Update
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts updates an existing user.
Frontend: The UserEditForm.vue component handles editing user data.
Pinia: The editUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the update action, modifying the state accordingly.
Delete
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts removes a user.
Frontend: The UserList.vue component includes a delete button to remove users.
Pinia: The removeUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the deletion action, updating the state.
Using Composables for API Interactions
Composables provide reusable logic for API interactions, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

Generated Fetch Composable
frontend/composables/useUser.ts:

typescript

import { useUserStore } from '../stores/user';

export const useUser = () => {
  const store = useUserStore();

  const getUserById = async (id: string) => {
    const user = store.users.find(user => user._id === id);
    if (user) {
      return user;
    }
    await store.getUsers();
    return store.users.find(user => user._id === id);
  };

  return { getUserById };
};
Purpose: Provides a reusable function to fetch a user by ID, leveraging the Pinia store.
Usage: Import and use in Vue components to retrieve user data seamlessly.
Example Usage in a Component
vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useUser } from '../composables/useUser';

const { getUserById } = useUser();
const user = ref(null);

const fetchUser = async (id: string) => {
  user.value = await getUserById(id);
};
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchUser('123')">Fetch User 123</button>
    <div v-if="user">
      <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
      <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
Purpose: Demonstrates how to utilize the composable to fetch and display user data.
Usage: Enhances component reusability and simplifies data fetching logic.
Best Practices
Modular Architecture: Organize your codebase into clearly defined modules for models, API routes, stores, and components to enhance scalability and maintainability.
Automated Code Generation: Utilize Hygen templates to reduce boilerplate, maintain consistency, and accelerate development.
State Management with Pinia: Leverage Pinia for efficient and type-safe state management, especially when integrated with TypeScript.
Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern: Implement the BFF pattern using Nitro within Nuxt 4 to tailor backend interactions to frontend needs, optimizing data handling and reducing unnecessary data transmission.
Composables for Reusability: Use composables to encapsulate and reuse API interaction logic across different components, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
Type Safety: Incorporate TypeScript throughout the project to enhance code reliability, maintainability, and developer experience.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling in both backend API routes and frontend components to ensure a robust and user-friendly application.
Security: Validate and sanitize all incoming data on the backend to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS attacks, and unauthorized access.
Performance Optimization: Utilize caching strategies within the BFF layer to reduce latency and improve application performance, especially for frequently accessed data.
Documentation and Comments: Maintain clear documentation and in-code comments to facilitate team collaboration and future maintenance.

You are not paying attention. We are not using mongose. 

Getting started with AshJsonApi
Installing AshJsonApi
Using Igniter (recommended)
mix igniter.install ash_json_api
Manually
This manual setup branches off from the Getting Started with Ash guide. If you aren't starting from there, replace the application name, Helpdesk, with your application name, and replace the Ash.Domain name, Helpdesk.Support with a domain or domains from your own application.

Add the ash_json_api dependency
In your mix.exs, add the Ash JSON API dependency:

  defp deps do
    [
      # .. other dependencies
      {:ash_json_api, "~> 1.0"},
    ]
  end
Accept json_api content type
Add the following to your config/config.exs.

# config/config.exs
config :mime,
  extensions: %{"json" => "application/vnd.api+json"},
  types: %{"application/vnd.api+json" => ["json"]}
This configuration is required to support working with the JSON:API custom mime type.

After adding the configuration above, compiling the project might throw an error:

ERROR! the application :mime has a different value set for key :types during runtime compared to compile time.
This can happen if :mime was already compiled before the configuration was changed and can be fixed by running

mix deps.compile mime --force
Create a router
Create a separate Router Module to work with your Domains. It will generate the routes for your Resources and provide the functions you would usually have in a Controller.

We will later forward requests from your Applications primary (Phoenix) Router to you Ash JSON API Router.

defmodule HelpdeskWeb.JsonApiRouter do
  use AshJsonApi.Router,
    # The api modules you want to serve
    domains: [Module.concat(["Helpdesk.Support"])],
    # optionally an open_api route
    open_api: "/open_api"
end
Whats up with Module.concat/1? {: .info}
This Module.concat/1 prevents a compile-time dependency from this router module to the domain modules. It is an implementation detail of how forward/2 works that you end up with a compile-time dependency on the schema, but there is no need for this dependency, and that dependency can have drastic impacts on your compile times in certain scenarios.

Additionally, your Resource requires a type, a base route and a set of allowed HTTP methods and what action they will trigger.

Add AshJsonApi.Plug.Parser to your endpoint
This handles any file uploads, if you have resource actions with the :file type.

plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json, AshJsonApi.Plug.Parser], # <- add it to this list.
  pass: ["*/*"],
  json_decoder: Jason
You don't have to add this if you don't plan on doing any file uploads, but there is no cost to adding it, even if you don't use it.

Add the routes from your domain module(s)
To make your Resources accessible to the outside world, forward requests from your Phoenix router to the router you created for your domains.

For example:

scope "/api/json" do
  pipe_through(:api)

  forward "/helpdesk", HelpdeskWeb.JsonApiRouter
end
Configure your Resources and Domain and expose actions
These examples are based off of the Getting Started with Ash guide.

Add the AshJsonApi extension to your domain and resource
Using Igniter (recommended)
To set up an existing resource of your own with AshJsonApi, run:

mix ash.patch.extend Your.Resource.Name json_api
Manually
Add to your domain:

defmodule Helpdesk.Support do
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Domain]
  ...
And to your resource:

defmodule Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Resource]
  # ...
  json_api do
    type "ticket"
  end
end
Define Routes
Routes can be defined on the resource or the domain. If you define them on the domain (which is our default recommendation), the resource in question must still use the AshJsonApi.Resource extension, and define its own type.

Defining routes on the domain
defmodule Helpdesk.Support do
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Domain]

  json_api do
    routes do
      # in the domain base_route acts like a scope
      base_route "/tickets", Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
        get :read
        index :read
        post :open
      end
    end
  end
end
And then add the extension and type to the resource:

defmodule Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Resource]
  # ...
  json_api do
    type "ticket"
  end
end
Defining routes on the resource
Here we show an example of defining routes on the resource.

defmodule Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Resource]
  # ...
  json_api do
    type "ticket"

    routes do
      # on the resource, the base applies to all routes
      base "/tickets"

      get :read
      index :read
      post :open
      # ...
    end
  end
end
Check out the AshJsonApi.Resource documentation on Hex for more information.

Run your API
From here on out its the standard Phoenix behavior. Start your application with mix phx.server and your API should be ready to try out. Should you be wondering what routes are available, you can print all available routes for each Resource:

Helpdesk.Support.Ticket
|> AshJsonApi.Resource.Info.routes(Helpdesk.Support)
Make sure that all requests you make to the API use the application/vnd.api+json type in both the Accept and Content-Type (where applicable) headers. The Accept header may be omitted.

Examples:

Create a ticket
curl -X POST 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data-raw '{
  "data": {
    "type": "ticket",
    "attributes": {
      "subject": "This ticket was created through the JSON API"
    }
  }
}'
Get all tickets
curl 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets'
Get a specific ticket
# Add the uuid of a Ticket you created earlier
curl 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets/<uuid>'
Open API
If you want to expose your API via Swagger UI or Redoc, see the open api documentation.

# Guide to Building a Full-Stack CRUD Application with Nuxt 4 and AshJsonApi

Creating a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application involves seamless integration between the frontend and backend. Leveraging **Nuxt 4** with **Nitro**, **Pinia** for state management, and **Hygen** for automating boilerplate code enhances development efficiency and ensures consistency. This guide explores implementing the **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** architectural pattern using **AshJsonApi** without relying on external backend frameworks like Express.js or state management libraries like Vuex.

## Common Misconceptions

Before delving into the implementation, it's essential to address common misconceptions that developers might have about the involved technologies and patterns:

1. **Nuxt 4 Requires Mongoose for Backend Models**
   - *Reality*: **Nuxt 4** can integrate with various backend solutions, including **AshJsonApi**, which does not use Mongoose.

2. **CRUD Operations in Nuxt 4 Necessarily Use Express.js**
   - *Reality*: With **Nitro**, **Nuxt 4** can handle server-side API routes without the need for Express.js.

3. **AshJsonApi and Phoenix APIs are Not Compatible with Nuxt 4**
   - *Reality*: **AshJsonApi** can be integrated with **Nuxt 4** using composables and API clients to perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

4. **Hygen Templates Are Only for Mongoose-Based Backends**
   - *Reality*: **Hygen** templates can be customized to work with any backend, including **AshJsonApi**.

5. **Pinia Cannot Be Integrated with AshJsonApi-Based Backends**
   - *Reality*: **Pinia** can effectively manage state in **Nuxt 4**, even when the backend is managed by **AshJsonApi**.

6. **AshJsonApi Requires Separate Setup Outside of Nuxt 4**
   - *Reality*: **AshJsonApi** can be set up alongside **Nuxt 4** within the same project, leveraging the BFF pattern.

7. **BFF Pattern Necessitates Using Vuex Instead of Pinia**
   - *Reality*: The **BFF** pattern is independent of the state management library; **Pinia** can be used effectively.

8. **Using AshJsonApi is Incompatible with Nuxt's Composables**
   - *Reality*: **Composables** can be designed to interact with **AshJsonApi** through generated fetch composables, enhancing code reusability.

## Project Structure

Organizing your project structure effectively is vital for scalability and maintainability. Here's a combined structure for both backend and frontend within a single **Nuxt 4** project:

project/ backend/ models/ user.ts api/ user.ts index.ts frontend/ components/ UserList.vue UserForm.vue UserEditForm.vue composables/ useUser.ts stores/ user.ts index.ts services/ userApi.ts _templates/ backend/ model/ new/ model.ejs.t api/ new/ handler.ejs.t inject_handler.ejs.t route.ejs.t inject_route.ejs.t frontend/ pinia/ module/ new/ store.ejs.t inject_store.ejs.t component/ new/ list.ejs.t form.ejs.t editForm.ejs.t service/ new/ api.ejs.t

yaml


- **backend/**: Contains **AshJsonApi** server routes and data models.
- **frontend/**: Houses Vue components, **Pinia** stores, composables, and API services.
- **_templates/**: **Hygen** templates for generating backend and frontend code.

---

## Setting Up the Backend with AshJsonApi

### Installing AshJsonApi

To set up **AshJsonApi**, follow these steps:

#### Using Igniter (Recommended)

Execute the following command to install **AshJsonApi**:

```bash
mix igniter.install ash_json_api
Manually
If you prefer manual setup, follow these steps:

Add the AshJsonApi Dependency

In your mix.exs, add the AshJsonApi dependency:

elixir

defp deps do
  [
    # ... other dependencies
    {:ash_json_api, "~> 1.0"},
  ]
end
Accept JSON
Content Type

Add the following to your config/config.exs:

elixir

# config/config.exs
config :mime,
  extensions: %{"json" => "application/vnd.api+json"},
  types: %{"application/vnd.api+json" => ["json"]}
This configuration supports working with the JSON
custom MIME type.

Note: After adding the configuration, you might encounter an error:

vbnet

ERROR! the application :mime has a different value set for key :types during runtime compared to compile time.
Fix this by running:

bash

mix deps.compile mime --force
Create a Router

Create a separate Router Module to work with your Domains. This router will generate routes for your Resources and provide functions you would typically have in a Controller.

backend/api/user.ts:

elixir

defmodule HelpdeskWeb.JsonApiRouter do
  use AshJsonApi.Router,
    domains: [Module.concat(["Helpdesk.Support"])],
    open_api: "/open_api"
end
Note: Module.concat/1 prevents a compile-time dependency from this router module to the domain modules, optimizing compile times.

Add AshJsonApi.Plug.Parser to Your Endpoint

This handles any file uploads if your resource actions include the :file type.

elixir

plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json, AshJsonApi.Plug.Parser],
  pass: ["*/*"],
  json_decoder: Jason
Optional: You can omit AshJsonApi.Plug.Parser if you don't plan on handling file uploads.

Forward Routes from Phoenix Router to AshJsonApi Router

To make your Resources accessible, forward requests from your Phoenix router to the AshJsonApi router.

elixir

scope "/api/json" do
  pipe_through(:api)

  forward "/helpdesk", HelpdeskWeb.JsonApiRouter
end
Configure Resources and Domain

Using Igniter (Recommended)

To set up an existing resource with AshJsonApi, run:

bash

mix ash.patch.extend Your.Resource.Name json_api
Manually

Add AshJsonApi Extension to Domain

elixir

defmodule Helpdesk.Support do
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Domain]
  # ... other configurations
end
Add AshJsonApi Extension to Resource

elixir

defmodule Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Resource]
  # ... other configurations

  json_api do
    type "ticket"
  end
end
Define Routes

Routes can be defined on the domain or the resource.

Defining Routes on the Domain

elixir

defmodule Helpdesk.Support do
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Domain]

  json_api do
    routes do
      base_route "/tickets", Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
        get :read
        index :read
        post :open
      end
    end
  end
end
Defining Routes on the Resource

elixir

defmodule Helpdesk.Support.Ticket do
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshJsonApi.Resource]

  json_api do
    type "ticket"

    routes do
      base "/tickets"

      get :read
      index :read
      post :open
    end
  end
end
Recommendation: Define routes on the domain for better organization and scalability.

Run Your API

Start your application with:

bash

mix phx.server
Your API should now be ready. To view available routes for a Resource:

elixir

Helpdesk.Support.Ticket
|> AshJsonApi.Resource.Info.routes(Helpdesk.Support)
Important: Ensure all API requests use the application/vnd.api+json MIME type in both the Accept and Content-Type headers where applicable.

Example Requests:

Create a Ticket

bash

curl -X POST 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data-raw '{
  "data": {
    "type": "ticket",
    "attributes": {
      "subject": "This ticket was created through the JSON API"
    }
  }
}'
Get All Tickets

bash

curl 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets'
Get a Specific Ticket

bash

curl 'localhost:4000/api/json/helpdesk/tickets/<uuid>'
Setting Up the Frontend with Nuxt 4 and Pinia
Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the project root and install necessary packages:

bash

npm install nuxt@latest @nuxtjs/tailwindcss @pinia/nuxt hygen
Ensure Nitro is included as part of Nuxt 4's core.

Configuring Pinia
Set up Pinia for state management.

frontend/stores/user.ts:

typescript

import { defineStore } from 'pinia';
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { fetchUsers, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser } from '../services/userApi';

export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', () => {
  const users = ref([]);
  const loading = ref(false);
  const error = ref(null);

  const getUsers = async () => {
    loading.value = true;
    try {
      users.value = await fetchUsers();
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    } finally {
      loading.value = false;
    }
  };

  const addUser = async (data: { name: string; username: string; email: string }) => {
    try {
      const newUser = await createUser(data);
      users.value.push(newUser);
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  const editUser = async (id: string, data: { name?: string; username?: string; email?: string }) => {
    try {
      const updated = await updateUser(id, data);
      const index = users.value.findIndex(user => user.id === id);
      if (index !== -1) {
        users.value[index] = updated;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  const removeUser = async (id: string) => {
    try {
      await deleteUser(id);
      users.value = users.value.filter(user => user.id !== id);
    } catch (err) {
      error.value = err;
    }
  };

  return { users, loading, error, getUsers, addUser, editUser, removeUser };
});
frontend/stores/index.ts:

typescript

import { createPinia } from 'pinia';
import { useUserStore } from './user';

const pinia = createPinia();

export { pinia, useUserStore };

Implementing CRUD Operations
This section demonstrates implementing CRUD operations using the generated templates and integrating them into the Nuxt 4 application.

Create
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts handles user creation.
Frontend: The UserForm.vue component allows users to input new user data.
Pinia: The addUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the creation action, updating the state upon successful creation.
Read
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts fetches all users.
Frontend: The UserList.vue component displays the list of users.
Pinia: The getUsers action in frontend/stores/user.ts retrieves users from the backend and updates the state.
Update
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts updates an existing user.
Frontend: The UserEditForm.vue component handles editing user data.
Pinia: The editUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the update action, modifying the state accordingly.
Delete
Backend: The API handler in backend/api/user.ts removes a user.
Frontend: The UserList.vue component includes a delete button to remove users.
Pinia: The removeUser action in frontend/stores/user.ts dispatches the deletion action, updating the state.
Using Composables for API Interactions
Composables provide reusable logic for API interactions, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

Generated Fetch Composable
frontend/composables/useUser.ts:

typescript

import { useUserStore } from '../stores/user';

export const useUser = () => {
  const store = useUserStore();

  const getUserById = async (id: string) => {
    const user = store.users.find(user => user.id === id);
    if (user) {
      return user;
    }
    await store.getUsers();
    return store.users.find(user => user.id === id);
  };

  return { getUserById };
};
Purpose: Provides a reusable function to fetch a user by ID, leveraging the Pinia store.
Usage: Import and use in Vue components to retrieve user data seamlessly.
Example Usage in a Component
vue

<script setup lang="ts">

import { useUser } from '../composables/useUser';

const { getUserById } = useUser();
const user = ref(null);

const fetchUser = async (id: string) => {
  user.value = await getUserById(id);
};
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchUser('123')">Fetch User 123</button>
    <div v-if="user">
      <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
      <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
Purpose: Demonstrates how to utilize the composable to fetch and display user data.
Usage: Enhances component reusability and simplifies data fetching logic.
Best Practices
Modular Architecture: Organize your codebase into clearly defined modules for models, API routes, stores, and components to enhance scalability and maintainability.

# Comprehensive Guide to Building a Full-Stack CRUD Application with Nuxt 4 and AshJsonApi using Hygen Templates

Building a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application involves seamlessly integrating frontend and backend technologies. This guide focuses on creating such an application using **Nuxt 4** for the frontend, **AshJsonApi** for the backend, **Pinia** for state management, and **Hygen** for automating code generation. We will follow best practices and ensure cohesion throughout the development process.

## Common Misconceptions

Before we begin, let's address some common misconceptions about the technologies and concepts involved:

1. **Nuxt 4 Requires Express.js for Backend Routes**
   - *Reality*: With **Nuxt 4** and **Nitro**, you can handle server-side routes without Express.js.

2. **AshJsonApi is Incompatible with Nuxt.js**
   - *Reality*: **AshJsonApi** can be consumed by a Nuxt.js frontend via JSON API endpoints.

3. **Mongoose is Necessary for Backend Models**
   - *Reality*: We can use **AshJsonApi** in the backend without Mongoose.

4. **Vuex is Required for State Management**
   - *Reality*: **Pinia** is the recommended state management library for Vue 3 and integrates well with Nuxt 4.

5. **Hygen Can Only Be Used with Specific Frameworks**
   - *Reality*: **Hygen** is a versatile code generator that can be customized for any framework or library.

6. **Backend and Frontend Must Be in Separate Projects**
   - *Reality*: You can manage both within the same project, especially using the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern.

7. **AshJsonApi Cannot Be Used with Composables**
   - *Reality*: Composables can be created to interact with AshJsonApi endpoints in a Nuxt 4 application.

8. **Best Practices Are Not Applicable When Using Custom Libraries**
   - *Reality*: Best practices should always be followed, regardless of the libraries or frameworks used.

## Planning the Hygen Templates

To automate code generation using **Hygen**, we need to plan our templates carefully to align with the technologies we're using.

### Template Structure

Our **Hygen** templates will be organized as follows:

_templates/ frontend/ store/ new/ store.js.ejs.t component/ new/ list.vue.ejs.t form.vue.ejs.t editForm.vue.ejs.t composable/ new/ api.js.ejs.t backend/ resource/ new/ resource.ex.ejs.t

yaml


### Templates Overview

- **frontend/store/new/store.js.ejs.t**
  - Generates a Pinia store for a specific resource.

- **frontend/component/new/list.vue.ejs.t**
  - Generates a Vue component to list items.

- **frontend/component/new/form.vue.ejs.t**
  - Generates a Vue component for creating new items.

- **frontend/component/new/editForm.vue.ejs.t**
  - Generates a Vue component for editing existing items.

- **frontend/composable/new/api.js.ejs.t**
  - Generates a composable for interacting with the resource API.

- **backend/resource/new/resource.ex.ejs.t**
  - Generates an Ash resource module with AshJsonApi configuration.

bash

mkdir _templates
Planning Your Templates
Before creating templates, plan the components and modules you need for your CRUD application. Identify the repetitive patterns in your codebase that can be automated.

Components to Template
Backend Resources: AshJsonApi resources, routes, and configurations.
Frontend Stores: Pinia stores for state management.
API Composables: Functions for interacting with backend APIs.
Vue Components: List, form, and detail components for each entity.
Tests: Unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
Template Structure
Organize your templates in a logical directory structure within the _templates folder:

arduino

_templates/
  backend/
    resource/
      new/
        prompts.js
        resource.ejs.t
  frontend/
    store/
      new/
        prompts.js
        store.ejs.t
    component/
      new/
        prompts.js
        list.ejs.t
        form.ejs.t
        detail.ejs.t

- **API Composables**: Functions for interacting with backend APIs.
- **Vue Components**: List, form, and detail components for each entity.
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

### Template Structure

Organize your templates in a logical directory structure within the `_templates` folder:

_templates/
  backend/
    resource/
      new/
        prompts.js
        resource.ejs.t
  frontend/
    store/
      new/
        prompts.js
        store.ejs.t
    component/
      new/
        prompts.js
        list.ejs.t
        form.ejs.t
        detail.ejs.t
    composable/
      new/
        prompts.js
        api.ejs.t
---

## Creating Hygen Templates

### Backend Templates

#### 1. Resource Template

- **Purpose**: Generate an Ash resource with CRUD actions and JSON API configurations.
- **Template File**: `_templates/backend/resource/new/resource.ejs.t`

**Best Practices**:

- Define all CRUD actions (`create`, `read`, `update`, `destroy`).
- Use `uuid_primary_key` for unique identifiers.
- Include necessary extensions (`AshJsonApi.Resource`).

#### Template Variables

- `name`: Singular name of the resource (e.g., `ticket`).
- `fields`: Array of field names (e.g., `["subject", "description", "status"]`).
- `appName`: Application name in snake_case.
- `appModule`: Application module name in PascalCase.

#### prompts.js

Include a `prompts.js` file to interactively collect necessary variables when generating the template.

---

### Frontend Templates

#### 1. Store Template

- **Purpose**: Generate a Pinia store for state management of a resource.
- **Template File**: `_templates/frontend/store/new/store.ejs.t`

**Best Practices**:

- Use the Composition API.
- Handle loading and error states.
- Separate API interactions into composables.

#### 2. API Composable Template

- **Purpose**: Generate a composable for API interactions with the backend.
- **Template File**: `_templates/frontend/composable/new/api.ejs.t`

**Best Practices**:

- Use `ohmyfetch` or Nuxt's built-in `useFetch` for HTTP requests.
- Follow JSON API specifications for headers and payload structure.
- Handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

#### 3. Component Templates

- **List Component**: Displays a list of items.
  - **Template File**: `_templates/frontend/component/new/list.ejs.t`
- **Form Component**: Used for creating new items.
  - **Template File**: `_templates/frontend/component/new/form.ejs.t`
- **Detail Component**: Displays item details and allows editing.
  - **Template File**: `_templates/frontend/component/new/detail.ejs.t`

**Best Practices**:

- Use `setup` script and the Composition API.
- Utilize `v-model` for form inputs.
- Implement client-side validation.
- Ensure accessibility by using proper HTML semantics.

#### Template Variables

- `name`: Singular name of the resource.
- `fields`: Array of field names.

#### prompts.js

Create a `prompts.js` file to collect variables interactively during template generation.

---

## Generating Code with Hygen

After setting up your templates, use Hygen commands to generate code.

### Generate a Backend Resource
bash
hygen backend resource new
**Process**:

- Hygen will prompt for the resource name, fields, application name, and module.
- It generates the Ash resource file with the specified configurations.

### Generate Frontend Components
bash
hygen frontend store new
hygen frontend composable new
hygen frontend component new
**Process**:

- Hygen prompts for the necessary variables.
- It generates the Pinia store, API composable, and Vue components.

---

## Integrating Generated Code

### Backend Integration

- **Compile and Migrate**: Ensure that your Elixir application compiles and migrations are run if necessary.
- **Update Router**: Include the generated resources in your application's router if required.
- **Test API Endpoints**: Use tools like `curl` or Postman to verify that the API endpoints are working as expected.

### Frontend Integration

- **Register Store**: Import and register the generated Pinia store in your application.
- **Update Routes**: Add routes for the generated components in your Nuxt application's router.
- **Import Components**: Use the generated components in your pages or layouts.
- **Configure Composables**: Ensure that the API base URLs and endpoints are correctly configured.

Common Misconceptions About the Concepts:

Hygen Cannot Fully Automate CRUD Applications: Some people believe that Hygen is limited to generating simple code snippets and cannot handle the full automation of CRUD applications, requiring manual code updates.

Nuxt 4 Features Cannot Be Generated via Hygen: There is a misconception that advanced Nuxt 4 features cannot be scaffolded using code generation tools and must be coded by hand.

Ash Framework is Only for Basic APIs: Some assume that Ash is limited to basic API functionalities and does not support advanced features like JSON API integration or complex resource management.

Manual Coding is Necessary for Best Practices: The belief that adhering to best practices requires manual coding and cannot be achieved through code generation.

The PLAN Pro Stack Cannot Be Fully Automated: Some might think that the integration of Phoenix, LLMs, Ash, and Nuxt.js in the PLAN Pro Stack cannot be fully scaffolded using automation tools.

Dynamic Import Paths and Component Names
By providing these missing templates, we now have a comprehensive set of Hygen templates that cover both the backend (Ash Framework) and frontend (Nuxt 4 with Pinia) components necessary for scaffolding a full-stack CRUD application. These templates utilize advanced EJS techniques such as loops, conditionals, helper functions, dynamic file paths, and code injections to provide rich functionality and flexibility during code generation.

Note: Remember to install necessary helper libraries and configure Hygen to use them. For example, in your .hygen.js file:

javascript

const changeCase = require('change-case');
const inflection = require('inflection');
const moment = require('moment');

module.exports = {
  helpers: {
    changeCase,
    inflection,
    now: (format) => moment().format(format),
  },
};
Install the required packages:

bash

npm install change-case inflection moment
Additionally, ensure that your prompts.js files collect all necessary input from the user to populate these templates correctly.

By leveraging these templates and techniques, you can automate the scaffolding of enterprise applications using the PLAN Pro Stack, adhering to best practices and minimizing the need for manual coding.




You said:
Redux
Redux is the posterchild of hygen. It doesn't matter what level of granularity you select for your Redux architecture, you're still going to end up with a lot of boilerplate.

For my app architecture I mostly choose ducks, which helps remove a little bit of boilerplate and have modularity baked in.

My typical Redux architecture would look like this:

app/
  components/
    icon.js
    avatar.js
  modules/
    boot.js     <---- glues modules together, requires chat, app, and auth.
    app/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    auth/
      index.js
      view.js
      state.js
    chat/
      index.js  <---- the 'connect' bit for Redux.
      view.js   <---- the view, separated, for testing.
      state.js  <---- reducer, actions, types, selectors.
Adding a Module#
Being a modular architecture, there's a huge plus for adding a module. It just means adding a folder, and index, view, state, perhaps a default component, a storybook story, and wiring every thing togather such as a reducer, exported actions and more in boot.js. Fun.

Should be a breeze with hygen. Here's how your templates look like:

_templates/
  module/
    new/
      index.ejs.t
      view.ejs.t
      state.ejs.t
      inject_boot.ejs.t   <--- adds a 'require' clause to boot.js
Here's how index looks like:

---
to: app/modules/<%= name %>/index.js
---
//
// requires, mappings, etc....
//
export default connect(...)(<%= Name %>)
A similar trick would do for view and state.

How would we add a require line given that boot.js looks like this?

// ... some bootstrapping code ...

const modules = [
  //     --- we want to inject "after" this
  require('auth').default,
  require('app').default
]

// ... rest of bootstrapping code ...
Let's build inject_boot.ejs.t. We have to use inject: true because this is an inject template and to locate our injected line after const modules =...:

---
to: app/modules/boot.js
inject: true
skip_if: <%= name %>
after: "const modules = ["
---
require('./<%= name %>).default,
After running it, we end up with this:

// ... some bootstrapping code ...

const modules = [
  require('chat').default
  require('auth').default,
  require('app').default
]

// ... rest of bootstrapping code ...
And we're done! Generating a new module is saying this:

$ hygen module new --name settings



Review this to identify all the injections required for the PLAN Pro Stack. Do not reference Redux or React in your reply. We do not support those in PLAN Pro Stack
ChatGPT

Thought for 11 seconds

Certainly! When scaffolding applications using the PLAN Pro Stack (Phoenix, Large Language Models, Ash, and Nuxt.js), certain files need to be dynamically updated or injected with new code whenever you add new resources or modules. This ensures that your application remains cohesive and that all components are properly connected.

Below, we'll identify all the injections required for the PLAN Pro Stack and provide Hygen templates that perform these injections, using advanced EJS techniques for rich functionality.

Overview of Injections in the PLAN Pro Stack
Backend (Phoenix/Ash Framework)
Updating the Phoenix Router: Inject new API routes for the generated resources.
Updating the Supervision Tree: Register new Ash resources or APIs in the application's supervision tree.
Updating the Endpoint Configuration: Include new plugs or middleware if necessary.
Updating Policy Files: Inject new policies or permissions.
Updating Mix Configurations: Add configurations for new dependencies or settings.
Frontend (Nuxt.js with Pinia)
Updating the Pinia Store Index: Register new stores.
Updating Nuxt Configuration: Include new modules, plugins, or middleware.
Adding Routes: If using a central routing file, inject new routes.
Updating Plugins: Inject configurations into existing plugins if needed.
Modifying Layouts or Components: Inject code into shared layouts or components.
Hygen Templates for Required Injections

---
import <%= h.changeCase.pascalCase(name) %> from '@/components/<%= h.changeCase.pascalCase(name) %>.vue'
app.component('<%= h.changeCase.pascalCase(name) %>', <%= h.changeCase.pascalCase(name) %>)
Explanation:

Purpose: Registers a component globally, so it can be used anywhere without importing.
Advanced Techniques:
Properly imports the component and registers it.
Uses skip_if to prevent duplicate registrations.
Example Usage and Generation
When you generate a new resource or component, you can use Hygen to not only create new files but also inject necessary code into existing files to wire everything together.

Generating a New Backend Resource
Command:

bash

hygen backend resource new --name User --appName my_app --appModule MyApp
Hygen Actions:

Creates user.ex in lib/my_app/resources/.
Creates migration file in priv/repo/migrations/.
Injects routes into router.ex.
Updates supervision tree in application.ex.
Generating a New Frontend Store and Component
Command:

bash

hygen frontend store new --name user
hygen frontend component new --name user --fields name:string,email:string
Hygen Actions:

Creates user.js in stores/.
Injects store registration into stores/index.js.
Creates UserList.vue, UserForm.vue, etc., in components/.
Injects routes if necessary.
Updates nuxt.config.js if plugins or modules are required.
Advanced EJS Techniques in Templates
Conditional Injections:

Use conditionals to check if certain features or configurations are needed before injecting.

ejs

<% if (includeAuthentication) { %>
import AuthMiddleware from './auth'
app.use(AuthMiddleware)
<% } %>
Loops for Multiple Injections:

When injecting multiple items, such as multiple routes or middleware.

ejs

<% routes.forEach(route => { %>
{
  path: '<%= route.path %>',
  component: () => import('<%= route.component %>'),
},
<% }); %>
Helper Functions for String Manipulation:

Use helper libraries like change-case and inflection for consistent naming conventions.

ejs

const resourceName = h.changeCase.pascalCase(name)
const resourcePlural = h.changeCase.paramCase(h.inflection.pluralize(name))
Skip Duplicate Injections:

Use skip_if to prevent injecting the same code multiple times.

ejs

skip_if: "import <%= h.changeCase.camelCase(name) %> from './<%= h.changeCase.camelCase(name) %>'"
Ensuring Idempotency and Avoiding Duplicates
When injecting code into existing files, it's crucial to avoid duplications that can cause syntax errors or unintended behavior.

Use skip_if Parameter:

This parameter checks if a particular string exists in the file before injecting.

ejs

skip_if: "require('./<%= name %>').default,"
Careful Placement with after and before:

Ensure that code is injected at the correct location by specifying the context.

ejs

after: 'const modules = ['
Testing Injections:

Regularly test the code generation process to ensure injections are working as expected.

Summary
By identifying all the required injections for the PLAN Pro Stack and utilizing advanced EJS techniques in Hygen templates, you can automate the scaffolding of your application efficiently. This approach ensures that all components are properly wired together, adhering to best practices without the need for manual code edits.

Final Notes
Avoid Manual Edits: The goal is to automate the entire scaffolding process without handwriting code.
Maintain Templates: Keep your Hygen templates up-to-date with changes in your application's architecture or dependencies.
Leverage the Community: Look into existing Hygen templates for similar stacks and adapt them to fit the PLAN Pro Stack.
By following this approach, you ensure a consistent, efficient, and error-free codebase, allowing you to focus on building features rather than handling boilerplate and wiring code.

Design a python script that can walk the plan pro CLI help and infer what options and arguments to call to align with the code blueprint. Before you answer, make a list of wrong assumptions people sometimes make about the concepts included in the question then implement the script
ChatGPT

Thought for 38 seconds

Common Misconceptions About the Concepts:

Assumption that the CLI Help is Machine-Readable: People often assume that the output of the planpro CLI help command is structured in a way that is easy to parse programmatically. However, CLI help outputs are typically designed for human readability, not machine parsing, which can make automated parsing challenging.

One-to-One Mapping Between Blueprints and CLI Commands: There is a misconception that each code blueprint will directly correspond to a single CLI command with clear options and arguments. In reality, some blueprints may require multiple commands or complex option combinations.

Complete Information in Code Blueprints: It's assumed that the code blueprints contain all the necessary information to generate the exact CLI commands without any ambiguity. However, blueprints might lack certain details required for precise command generation.

Uniform CLI Command Structure: Some may believe that all commands and options in the CLI follow a uniform structure, making it straightforward to infer commands from blueprints. In practice, command structures can vary, requiring nuanced parsing and handling.

Script Can Handle All Edge Cases Automatically: There is an expectation that the script can automatically handle all possible edge cases and exceptions in the CLI help output without additional programming or error handling.

No Need for Error Handling or Validation: People might assume that the script doesn't need robust error handling or validation mechanisms, believing the inputs and outputs will always be correct and in the expected format.

Typer and CodeBlueprint Automate Everything: There's a misconception that using Typer and the CodeBlueprint class will automatically provide all the functionality needed to map blueprints to CLI commands without custom logic or implementation.

Python Script Design and Implementation
We will design a Python script that uses the Typer library to interact with the planpro CLI. The script will:

Execute the planpro CLI help command to retrieve available commands and options.
Parse the help output to build a representation of the CLI commands and their arguments.
Match the code blueprints to the appropriate CLI commands and options.
Generate the commands that need to be executed to align with each code blueprint.
Since the planpro CLI is not a real command we can execute, we'll simulate its help output for the purposes of this script.

Assumptions
The planpro CLI help output is accessible and can be captured as a string.
The help output follows a standard format similar to other CLI tools.
The script has access to the code blueprints as instances of the CodeBlueprint class.
Each code blueprint corresponds to a specific planpro generate command.

Explanation
get_planpro_help_output(): Simulates fetching the planpro --help output. Since we cannot actually run the command, we provide a simulated help output.

parse_cli_help(): Parses the help output to extract available commands.

get_command_options(): (Not extensively used in this script) Would parse the help output of specific commands to extract available options.

map_blueprint_to_command(): Maps each CodeBlueprint instance to the appropriate planpro generate command with inferred options and arguments. It tries to extract the resource_type and name from the files_to_create or message.

main(): Loads the code blueprints from a YAML file (blueprints.yaml), gets the CLI commands, and then maps each blueprint to a CLI command, printing the result.

Example Output
Given the blueprints provided earlier, the script would generate commands like:

graphql

# Blueprint: Generate backend resource for Subscription-Based AI Product
planpro generate resource subscription_product --app-name my_app --app-module MyApp

# Blueprint: Generate API routes for Subscription-Based AI Product
# Unable to map blueprint 'Generate API routes for Subscription-Based AI Product' to a command

# Blueprint: Generate frontend store for Subscription-Based AI Product
planpro generate store subscriptionProduct

# Blueprint: Generate frontend components for Subscription-Based AI Product
planpro generate component SubscriptionProductList

# Blueprint: Generate API composable for Subscription-Based AI Product
planpro generate composable SubscriptionProduct

...
Limitations and Considerations
Inference Accuracy: The script makes best-effort guesses to map blueprints to CLI commands. If the blueprints lack sufficient information, the mapping may not be accurate.

Assumed CLI Structure: The script assumes a certain structure of the planpro CLI and its commands, which may not reflect the actual implementation.

Option Details: The script doesn't handle detailed options like --fields unless explicitly provided in the blueprint's message.

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling but may need enhancements for robustness.

Extensibility: To improve the script, consider adding more sophisticated parsing of the blueprint's content and enhancing the CLI help parsing.

Conclusion
The provided Python script demonstrates how to parse code blueprints and map them to CLI commands by inferring options and arguments. By addressing the common misconceptions and carefully designing the script, we can automate the alignment between code blueprints and CLI commands, aiding in the scaffolding of enterprise applications using the PLAN Pro Stack.

Note: To run this script successfully:

Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install pydantic yaml
Save the Code Blueprints:

Save the YAML data provided earlier into a file named blueprints.yaml.

Run the Script:

bash

python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the actual name of your script file.

Disclaimer: Since we don't have access to the actual planpro CLI and its help outputs, the script uses simulated outputs and may need adjustments to work with the real CLI tool.

Structured Outputs
Introduction
JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structed Outputs include:

Reliable type-safety: No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
Explicit refusals: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
Simpler prompting: No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response
python

python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
Supported models
Structured Outputs are available in our latest large language models, starting with GPT-4o:

gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 and later
gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and later
Older models like gpt-4-turbo and earlier may use JSON mode instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response_format

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

When using function calling
When using a json_schema response format
Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via response_format are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured response_format
The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the Function Calling guide.

Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

Structured Outputs	JSON Mode
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }	response_format: { type: "json_object" }
Examples
UI Generation
You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs
python

python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class UIType(str, Enum):
    div = "div"
    button = "button"
    header = "header"
    section = "section"
    field = "field"
    form = "form"

class Attribute(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: str

class UI(BaseModel):
    type: UIType
    label: str
    children: List["UI"] 
    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild() # This is required to enable recursive types

class Response(BaseModel):
    ui: UI

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Make a User Profile Form"}
    ],
    response_format=Response,
)

ui = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
print(ui)

                        }
                    ]

            ],
            "attributes": []

        },
        {

            "value": "/submit-profile"
        }
    ]
}
How to use Structured Outputs with response_format

You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.

Note: the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 1: Define your object
First you must define an object or data structure to represent the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the examples at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See here for more details.

For example, you can define an object like this:

python

python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathResponse(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str
Tips for your data structure
To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

Name keys clearly and intuitively
Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case
Step 2: Supply your object in the API call
You can use the parse method to automatically parse the JSON response into the object you defined.

Under the hood, the SDK takes care of supplying the JSON schema corresponding to your data structure, and then parsing the response as an object.

python

python
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathResponse
  )
Step 3: Handle edge cases
In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

python

python
try:
    completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
        ],
        response_format=MathResponse,
        max_tokens=50
    )
    math_response = completion.choices[0].message
    if math_response.parsed:
        print(math_response.parsed)
    elif math_response.refusal:
        # handle refusal
        print(math_response.refusal)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle edge cases
    if type(e) == openai.LengthFinishReasonError:
        # Retry with a higher max tokens
        print("Too many tokens: ", e)
        pass
    else:
        # Handle other exceptions
        print(e)
        pass
Step 4: Use the generated structured data in a type-safe way
When using the SDK, you can use the parsed attribute to access the parsed JSON response as an object. This object will be of the type you defined in the response_format parameter.

python

python
math_response = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
print(math_response.steps)
print(math_response.final_answer)
Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in response_format, the API response will include a new field called refusal to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the refusal property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

python

python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
    print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
    print(math_reasoning.parsed)
The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

json

json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-9nYAG9LPNonX8DAyrkwYfemr3C8HC",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1721596428,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "choices": [
    {
	  "index": 0,
	  "message": {
            "role": "assistant",
            "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
	  },
	  "logprobs": null,
	  "finish_reason": "stop"
	}
  ],
  "usage": {
      "prompt_tokens": 81,
      "completion_tokens": 11,
      "total_tokens": 92,
      "completion_tokens_details": {
        "reasoning_tokens": 0
      }
  },
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_3407719c7f"
}
Tips and best practices

Handling user-generated input
If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

Handling mistakes
Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the prompt engineering guide for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

Avoid JSON schema divergence
To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Supported schemas
Structured Outputs supports a subset of the JSON Schema language.

Supported types
The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

String
Number
Boolean
Integer
Object
Array
Enum
anyOf
Root objects must not be anyOf
Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use anyOf. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an anyOf at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

javascript

javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
    BaseResponseSchema,
    UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
All fields must be required
To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as required.

json

json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with null.

json

json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size
A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

additionalProperties: false must always be set in objects
additionalProperties controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set additionalProperties: false to opt into Structured Outputs.

json

json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
Key ordering
When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported
Notable keywords not supported include:

For strings: minLength, maxLength, pattern, format
For numbers: minimum, maximum, multipleOf
For objects: patternProperties, unevaluatedProperties, propertyNames, minProperties, maxProperties
For arrays: unevaluatedItems, contains, minContains, maxContains, minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems
If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying strict: true and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

For anyOf, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset
Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

json

json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"item": {
			"anyOf": [
				{
					"type": "object",
					"description": "The user object to insert into the database",
					"properties": {
						"name": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The name of the user"
						},
						"age": {
							"type": "number",
							"description": "The age of the user"
						}
					},
					"additionalProperties": false,
					"required": [
						"name",
						"age"
					]
				},
				{
					"type": "object",
					"description": "The address object to insert into the database",
					"properties": {
						"number": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
						},
						"street": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
						},
						"city": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The city of the address"
						}
					},
					"additionalProperties": false,
					"required": [
						"number",
						"street",
						"city"
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"additionalProperties": false,
	"required": [
		"item"
	]
}
Definitions are supported
You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

json

json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"steps": {
			"type": "array",
			"items": {
				"$ref": "#/$defs/step"
			}
		},
		"final_answer": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	},
	"$defs": {
		"step": {
			"type": "object",
			"properties": {
				"explanation": {
					"type": "string"
				},
				"output": {
					"type": "string"
				}
			},
			"required": [
				"explanation",
				"output"
			],
			"additionalProperties": false
		}
	},
	"required": [
		"steps",
		"final_answer"
	],
	"additionalProperties": false
}
Recursive schemas are supported
Sample recursive schema using # to indicate root recursion.

json

json
{
        "name": "ui",
        "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
        "strict": true,
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "type": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The type of the UI component",
                    "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
                },
                "label": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
                },
                "children": {
                    "type": "array",

                    "items": {
                        "$ref": "#"
                    }
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                            },
                            "value": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The value of the attribute"
                            }
                        },
                      "additionalProperties": false,
                      "required": ["name", "value"]
                    }
                }
            },
            "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    }
Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

	},
	"additionalProperties": false,

}


Let's create a specification called CLIAPI which is the OpenAPI equivalent for CLIs. We could then use the structured output API to walk and choose what commands to execute

Creating a CLIAPI Specification and Using Structured Outputs to Execute Commands
Introduction
In the world of APIs, OpenAPI is a widely accepted standard for defining RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format. It allows developers to understand and interact with services without needing access to source code or documentation. Similarly, for Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs), having a standardized specification can greatly enhance automation, tooling, and integration capabilities.

CLIAPI is a proposed specification that serves as the OpenAPI equivalent for CLIs. It provides a structured, machine-readable format to describe CLI commands, their arguments, options, and behaviors. By defining CLIs in this way, we can leverage tools like OpenAI's Structured Outputs to parse, navigate, and execute commands programmatically.

In this guide, we'll:

Define the CLIAPI specification.
Show how to represent CLI commands using CLIAPI.
Demonstrate how to use OpenAI's Structured Outputs to walk through the CLI commands.
Provide examples to illustrate how to choose and execute commands based on user input.
Defining the CLIAPI Specification
Objectives of CLIAPI
Standardization: Provide a consistent format to describe CLI applications.
Machine-Readable: Allow programs to parse and understand CLI structures.
Interoperability: Enable integration with tools, editors, and AI models.
Extensibility: Support complex command hierarchies and options.
Core Components of CLIAPI
Command: Represents a CLI command or subcommand.
Arguments: Positional parameters required by the command.
Options: Optional flags or parameters that modify command behavior.
Description: Human-readable explanation of the command and its components.
Examples: Usage examples to illustrate how to use the command.
CLIAPI Specification Format
We'll define the CLIAPI specification using JSON Schema, which allows us to represent the structure in a way that's compatible with OpenAI's Structured Outputs.

Here's the basic structure:

json

{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "arguments": [
        {
          "name": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "required": false,
          "default": "string",
          "aliases": ["string"]
        }
      ],
      "subcommands": [ /* Recursive Command Structure */ ]
    }
  ]
}
Example CLIAPI Specification
Let's create a CLIAPI specification for a hypothetical planpro CLI tool:

json

{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "generate",
      "description": "Generate code using PLAN Pro stack templates",
      "arguments": [
        {
          "name": "resource_type",
          "description": "Type of resource to generate (e.g., resource, store, component)",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "description": "Name of the resource",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "--fields",
          "description": "Fields for the resource (name:type)",

        }
      ]
    },

Using Structured Outputs to Walk and Choose Commands
Overview
By representing CLI commands in a structured format, we can use AI models to interpret user intents and map them to specific CLI commands. OpenAI's Structured Outputs feature ensures that the model's responses adhere to a defined schema, allowing us to reliably parse and execute commands.

Steps to Implement
Define the CLIAPI Specification: Create a JSON Schema representing the CLI commands.
Design the JSON Schema for Structured Outputs: This schema will define how the model should output the selected command and its parameters.
Prompt the Model with User Input and the CLIAPI Specification: Provide context so the model can understand the available commands.
Use the Structured Output API to Get the Model's Response: Ensure the response adheres to the schema.
Parse and Execute the Command: Programmatically run the command using the parsed output.
1. Define the JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
We'll define a JSON Schema that describes the expected output from the model when it selects a command to execute.

json

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "command": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The main command to execute"
    },
    "arguments": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "List of arguments for the command",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "options": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Key-value pairs of options and their values",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["command"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
2. Implementing with OpenAI's API
Python Example Using OpenAI SDK
python

import openai
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Define the structured output schema using Pydantic
class CommandOutput(BaseModel):
    command: str
    arguments: List[str]
    options: Dict[str, str]

# The CLIAPI specification (simplified for the example)
cliapi_spec = """
The available commands are:
1. generate
   - Description: Generate code using PLAN Pro stack templates
   - Arguments:
     - resource_type (required): Type of resource to generate
     - name (required): Name of the resource
   - Options:
     - --fields: Fields for the resource (name:type)
     - --app-name: Application name
     - --app-module: Application module
"""

# User input
user_input = "I need to create a backend resource called SubscriptionProduct with fields id:uuid, name:string"

# Construct the prompt
prompt = f"""
You are a CLI assistant. Based on the user's input, select the appropriate command to execute from the CLIAPI specification.

CLIAPI Specification:

"""

# Make the API call with Structured Outputs
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-0613",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that outputs JSON adhering to a specific schema."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    functions=[
        {
            "name": "command_output",
            "description": "The command to execute",
            "parameters": CommandOutput.schema()
        }
    ],
    function_call={"name": "command_output"}
)

# Parse the response
response_message = completion.choices[0].message
if 'function_call' in response_message:
    arguments = response_message['function_call']['arguments']
    command_output = CommandOutput.parse_raw(arguments)
    print("Command to execute:")
    print(f"{command_output.command} {' '.join(command_output.arguments)} with options {command_output.options}")
else:
    print("No command found.")
Expected Output
css

Command to execute:
generate resource SubscriptionProduct with options {'--fields': 'id:uuid, name:string'}
3. Executing the Command
Using the parsed output, you can programmatically construct and execute the CLI command.

python

import subprocess

# Construct the command
cmd = [
    "planpro",
    command_output.command,
    *command_output.arguments
]

# Add options
for option, value in command_output.options.items():
    cmd.extend([option, value])

# Execute the command
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)

# Check the result
if result.returncode == 0:
    print("Command executed successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Command failed with error: {result.stderr}")
Additional Examples
Example 2: Generating a Frontend Store
User Input: "Generate a frontend store for CustomerData"

Expected Command Execution:

Command: generate
Arguments: store, CustomerData
Options: None
Model Response:

json

{
  "command": "generate",
  "arguments": ["store", "CustomerData"],
  "options": {}
}
Tips for Using Structured Outputs with CLIAPI
Define Clear Schemas: Ensure that your JSON schemas are well-defined and cover all necessary fields.
Provide Detailed Specifications: The more information you include in your CLIAPI specification, the better the model can map user intents to commands.
Handle Ambiguities: Implement logic to handle cases where the user's input may map to multiple commands or require disambiguation.
Validate User Input: Always validate the model's output before executing commands to prevent unintended actions.
Conclusion
By creating a CLIAPI specification and leveraging OpenAI's Structured Outputs, we can build intelligent systems that interpret user intents and map them to CLI commands reliably. This approach enhances automation, reduces errors, and provides a scalable method to interact with complex CLI tools programmatically.

and combine with Code Blueprints. Extend the jinja templates for full CLIAPI support. Options, Arguments, Help, etc

2/2

ChatGPT

Thought for 40 seconds

Certainly! Let's create a script that reads a CLIAPI specification and generates Typer CLI commands using Jinja templates, fully supporting options, arguments, help texts, and subcommands.

We'll proceed with the following steps:

Define the CLIAPI Specification: We'll create Pydantic models to represent the CLIAPI, including commands, subcommands, arguments, options, and help texts.

Extend the Jinja Templates: We'll update the Jinja templates to handle commands with options and arguments, including help text.

Write the Script: We'll write a script that reads the CLIAPI specification and uses the Jinja templates to generate the Typer CLI code.

Combine with CodeBlueprints: We'll integrate the CodeBlueprint class to enhance the functionality if needed.

1. Define the CLIAPI Specification
First, we'll define the Pydantic models for the CLIAPI specification.

python

from typing import List, Optional, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CLIOption(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the option (e.g., '--verbose')")
    type: str = Field(default='str', description="The type of the option (e.g., 'str', 'int', 'bool')")
    help: Optional[str] = Field(default='', description="The help text for the option")
    required: bool = Field(default=False, description="Whether the option is required")
    default: Optional[Union[str, int, bool]] = Field(default=None, description="The default value for the option")
    is_flag: bool = Field(default=False, description="Whether the option is a flag (boolean)")
    aliases: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Aliases for the option")

class CLIArgument(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the argument")
    type: str = Field(default='str', description="The type of the argument (e.g., 'str', 'int')")
    help: Optional[str] = Field(default='', description="The help text for the argument")
    required: bool = Field(default=True, description="Whether the argument is required")
    default: Optional[Union[str, int, bool]] = Field(default=None, description="The default value for the argument")

class CLICommand(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the command")
    help: Optional[str] = Field(default='', description="The help text for the command")
    arguments: List[CLIArgument] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of arguments for the command")
    options: List[CLIOption] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of options for the command")
    subcommands: List["CLICommand"] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of subcommands")
    callback: Optional[str] = Field(default='', description="The callback function name for the command")

CLICommand.update_forward_refs()

class CLIApplication(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the CLI application")
    help: Optional[str] = Field(default='', description="The help text for the application")
    commands: List[CLICommand] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of top-level commands")
This setup allows us to represent commands, options, arguments, help texts, subcommands, and more.

2. Extend the Jinja Templates
cli_template.jinja
jinja

{% set indent = '    ' %}
import typer

app = typer.Typer(help="{{ model.help }}")

{% for command in model.commands %}
{% include 'command_template.jinja' %}
{% endfor %}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
command_template.jinja
jinja

{% macro generate_command(command, parent_app='app', level=0) %}
{% set indent = '    ' * level %}
{% if command.subcommands %}
{{ indent }}{{ command.name }}_app = typer.Typer(help="{{ command.help }}")
{{ indent }}{{ parent_app }}.add_typer({{ command.name }}_app, name="{{ command.name }}")

{% for subcommand in command.subcommands %}
{{ generate_command(subcommand, parent_app=command.name + '_app', level=level + 1) }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
{{ indent }}@{{ parent_app }}.command(name="{{ command.name }}", help="{{ command.help }}")
{{ indent }}def {{ command.name.replace('-', '_') }}(
{% for arg in command.arguments %}
{{ indent }}    {{ arg.name }}: {{ arg.type }} = typer.Argument({{ arg.default if arg.default is not none else '...' }}, help="{{ arg.help }}"),
{% endfor %}
{% for opt in command.options %}
{{ indent }}    {{ opt.name.lstrip('-').replace('-', '_') }}: {{ opt.type }} = typer.Option({{ opt.default if opt.default is not none else 'False' if opt.is_flag else 'None' }}, help="{{ opt.help }}"{% if opt.is_flag %}, is_flag=True{% endif %}),
{% endfor %}
{{ indent }}):
{{ indent }}    \"\"\"{{ command.help }}\"\"\"
{{ indent }}    # Command logic goes here
{{ indent }}    print("Executing command '{{ command.name }}'")
{% for arg in command.arguments %}
{{ indent }}    print("Argument {{ arg.name }}:", {{ arg.name }})
{% endfor %}
{% for opt in command.options %}
{{ indent }}    print("Option {{ opt.name }}:", {{ opt.name.lstrip('-').replace('-', '_') }})
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}
{% endmacro %}

{{ generate_command(command) }}
This template recursively generates commands and subcommands, including options and arguments.

pytest_template.jinja
jinja

import pytest
from typer.testing import CliRunner
from {{ model.name }} import app

runner = CliRunner()

{% for command in model.commands %}
{% include 'test_command_template.jinja' %}
{% endfor %}
test_command_template.jinja
jinja

{% macro generate_test(command, parent_command='', level=0) %}
{% set command_path = (parent_command + ' ' + command.name).strip() %}
def test_{{ command_path.replace(' ', '_') }}():
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["{{ command_path }}"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Executing command '{{ command.name }}'" in result.output
{% for arg in command.arguments %}
    # Adjust test as needed for arguments
{% endfor %}
{% for opt in command.options %}
    # Adjust test as needed for options
{% endfor %}

{% for subcommand in command.subcommands %}
{{ generate_test(subcommand, parent_command=command_path, level=level + 1) }}
{% endfor %}
{% endmacro %}

{{ generate_test(command) }}
This template recursively generates tests for commands and subcommands.

3. Write the Script
Here's the script that reads the CLIAPI specification and generates the Typer CLI code using the Jinja templates.

python

import os
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
from typing import Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Assuming the Pydantic models are defined as above

def generate_cli_code(cli_spec: Dict[str, Any], output_dir: str):
    # Parse the CLI spec into the CLIApplication model
    cli_app = CLIApplication.parse_obj(cli_spec)

    # Set up Jinja2 environment
    env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('templates'), trim_blocks=True, lstrip_blocks=True)

    # Load templates
    cli_template = env.get_template('cli_template.jinja')
    # command_template and test_command_template are included via 'include' in the main templates

    # Render the CLI code
    cli_code = cli_template.render(model=cli_app)

    # Write the CLI code to a file
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(output_dir, f"{cli_app.name}.py"), 'w') as f:
        f.write(cli_code)

    # Render the tests
    pytest_template = env.get_template('pytest_template.jinja')
    test_code = pytest_template.render(model=cli_app)

    # Write the test code to a file
    with open(os.path.join(output_dir, f"test_{cli_app.name}.py"), 'w') as f:
        f.write(test_code)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example CLIAPI specification
    cli_spec = {
        "name": "mycli",
        "help": "My CLI Application",
        "commands": [
            {
                "name": "generate",
                "help": "Generate code using PLAN Pro stack templates",
                "arguments": [
                    {
                        "name": "resource_type",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Type of resource to generate",
                        "required": True
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "name",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Name of the resource",
                        "required": True
                    }
                ],
                "options": [
                    {
                        "name": "--fields",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Fields for the resource (name:type)",
                        "required": False,
                        "default": None
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "--app-name",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Application name",
                        "required": False,
                        "default": None
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "--app-module",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Application module",
                        "required": False,
                        "default": None
                    }
                ],
                "subcommands": []
            },
            {
                "name": "init",
                "help": "Initialize a new PLAN Pro project",
                "arguments": [],
                "options": [
                    {
                        "name": "--template",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Project template to use",
                        "required": False,
                        "default": None
                    }
                ],
                "subcommands": []
            }
        ]
    }

    generate_cli_code(cli_spec, output_dir='generated_cli')
Notes:

Ensure that the templates are saved in a templates directory, or adjust the FileSystemLoader path.
The generate_cli_code function reads the CLI spec, renders the code using the templates, and writes the output files.
4. Combine with CodeBlueprints
Assuming you have CodeBlueprint instances, you can integrate them to generate the CLI specification dynamically.

Here's how you might do it:

python

def code_blueprints_to_cli_spec(blueprints: List[CodeBlueprint]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    commands = {}
    for blueprint in blueprints:
        # Simplified parsing logic
        if 'Generate backend resource' in blueprint.description:
            command_name = 'generate'
            resource_type = 'resource'
            name = blueprint.description.split('for ')[-1].replace(' ', '')
            options = []
            if '--fields' in blueprint.message:
                options.append({
                    "name": "--fields",
                    "type": "str",
                    "help": "Fields for the resource",
                    "required": False,
                    "default": None
                })
            commands[command_name] = {
                "name": command_name,
                "help": "Generate code",
                "arguments": [
                    {
                        "name": "resource_type",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Type of resource to generate",
                        "required": True
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "name",
                        "type": "str",
                        "help": "Name of the resource",
                        "required": True
                    }
                ],
                "options": options,
                "subcommands": []
            }
        # Handle other blueprint types similarly

    cli_spec = {
        "name": "mycli",
        "help": "My CLI Application",
        "commands": list(commands.values())
    }

    return cli_spec

# Example usage with blueprints
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Assume blueprints is a list of CodeBlueprint instances
    blueprints = [
        CodeBlueprint(
            description="Generate backend resource for Subscription-Based AI Product",
            files_to_create=["lib/my_app/resources/subscription_product.ex"],
            files_to_edit=[],
            read_only_files=[],
            message="Generate Ash resource and migration for subscription-based AI product",
            context_files=[]
        ),
        # Add more blueprints as needed
    ]

    cli_spec = code_blueprints_to_cli_spec(blueprints)
    generate_cli_code(cli_spec, output_dir='generated_cli')
Final Notes
Templates Directory: Make sure the Jinja templates (cli_template.jinja, command_template.jinja, pytest_template.jinja, test_command_template.jinja) are stored in a directory named templates.

Extensibility: You can extend the models and templates to include more features, such as handling default values, type annotations, and custom command logic.

Testing: The generated test code includes basic assertions. Modify the tests to suit the specific logic of your commands.

Error Handling: Add appropriate error handling in the script to manage invalid specifications or other exceptions.

Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

bash

pip install pydantic jinja2 typer pytest
Running the Generated CLI: After generating the code, you can run the CLI application by executing:

bash

python generated_cli/mycli.py --help
By following these steps, you can create a script that reads a CLIAPI specification and generates a fully functional Typer CLI application with support for commands, options, arguments, help texts, and tests, all using Jinja templates.

Feel free to customize and enhance the templates and script to meet your specific needs. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

This specification can be used to:

Generate Typer CLI Commands: By parsing this YAML, you can automatically generate Typer-based CLI commands using Jinja templates.
Create Documentation: The help texts provide detailed explanations that can be used to generate user manuals or online documentation.
Develop Automation Scripts: Tools and scripts can programmatically interact with the PLAN Pro CLI by referring to this specification.
Usage Example:

To generate a backend resource for a subscription-based AI product:

bash

planpro generate resource SubscriptionProduct --fields "id:uuid,name:string"
To install a plugin:

bash

planpro plugin install my_plugin
To run a workflow with parameters:

bash

planpro workflow run data_processing --params "input_file=data.csv,output_dir=/results"
Note:

Extensibility: You can extend this CLIAPI specification by adding more commands, options, or subcommands as needed.
Consistency: Ensure that all fields, especially required fields and default values, are accurately represented to avoid confusion during implementation.
Integration with Code Blueprints: This specification aligns with the code blueprints provided earlier, enabling automated scaffolding of resources and components.
Feel free to use this CLIAPI YAML specification as a foundation for your PLAN Pro CLI tool, and adjust it according to your project's specific requirements.

Create the BaseConfigs to represent everything a PLAN Pro Stack would need
ChatGPT

Thought for 23 seconds

Certainly! Let's create BaseConfig classes using confz to represent all the configurations that a PLAN Pro Stack application would need. We'll cover configurations for:

Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
API Server (Phoenix Framework)
Ash Framework
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Nuxt.js Frontend
Logging
Caching (e.g., Redis)
Authentication
Email Services
Third-Party Integrations
We'll use confz to allow configurations from files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.

### **Key Concepts for Long-Term Technology Flexibility**

#### 1. **Principles Over Technologies**
Instead of referencing current technologies (like Kubernetes, AWS, or specific AI frameworks), this specification centers on **capabilities and principles**. For example:
- **Business Process Automation** can be implemented using any orchestration or RPA tool.
- **Real-Time Decision Making** is not tied to any specific AI or machine learning framework but requires tools that provide real-time insights.
- **Multi-Cloud Interoperability** emphasizes that cloud platforms must be integrated, but does not specify which clouds or how they must be integrated, allowing for future innovation.

#### 2. **Capability-Driven Architecture**
By focusing on **capabilities** such as **data governance, business process automation, and AI integration**, the architecture can evolve without the need to redefine its core components when new technologies arise. The architecture ensures modularity and loose coupling, so components (e.g., cloud platforms, AI engines, or security protocols) can be swapped or upgraded without significant system re-engineering.

#### 3. **Compliance and Global Standards**
The specification is agnostic about how compliance is achieved, focusing on **auditability, real-time data governance**, and **automated reporting**. This ensures that whether the regulation is **GDPR** or a future privacy law, the core capabilities of **traceability**, **governance**, and **security** remain the same.

#### 4. **Modularity and Replaceability**
The architecture emphasizes that services and components should be **modular** and **loosely coupled**. This means that **any technology stack** that fulfills the requirements can be used and later replaced if a more advanced solution emerges.

#### 5. **Business Goals Over Tooling**
Instead of focusing on specific tools, the specification addresses the overarching business needs of **Fortune 10 companies**:
- **Global Compliance**: Achieved through traceability and governance, not a particular technology.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Implemented through decision-making frameworks, which could be done by any current or future AI tool.
- **Resilience and Scalability**: Managed through multi-cloud redundancy and global observability, agnostic of specific cloud providers.

---

### **Conclusion**

By defining the **.togafcontext specification** for **Fortune 10 companies** in terms of **capabilities, modularity, governance, and compliance**, the architecture remains **timeless and adaptable**. This approach ensures that the architecture evolves seamlessly with technological innovations, enabling global-scale operations while maintaining strict adherence to regulatory frameworks and business goals.

This specification avoids tying the architecture to specific tools like AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes, ensuring that future shifts in technology landscapes won’t require re-architecting but simply integrating new tools within an established, scalable, and flexible framework.

APS Syntax is massively extended Gherkin in YAML. Write all Syntax to represent SAFe and other major agile frameworks
ChatGPT

Thought for 4 seconds

Certainly! I'll provide you with the APS (Adversarial Agile Protocol Specification) syntax, which is an extended version of Gherkin written in YAML format. This syntax will represent the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and other major agile frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, and LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum).

Introduction to APS Syntax
APS Syntax extends the traditional Gherkin language by incorporating additional structures and metadata to support complex agile processes. It allows for the detailed specification of features, scenarios, roles, artifacts, events, and processes in a hierarchical and modular way.

The syntax is designed to be:

Expressive: Capable of describing complex scenarios and processes.
Structured: Organized in a way that supports modularity and reuse.
Extensible: Allows for customization and extension to fit specific frameworks.
APS Syntax Components
Before we delve into representing agile frameworks, let's understand the core components of APS Syntax.

1. Feature Files
A feature file contains a description of a feature, which includes scenarios and background information.

yaml

feature:

# Naming Conventions Context

The **Naming Conventions** within the **Agile Protocol Specification (APS)** provide a structured approach to file and directory naming. These conventions are designed to ensure that every filename communicates essential metadata clearly and concisely, supporting both human understanding and machine readability. Consistent naming standards facilitate efficient document management, retrieval, and integration with AI tools.

## Purpose

1. **Immediate Identification**: Ensure that filenames provide sufficient metadata to identify the content, version, state, author, and context of each file at a glance.
2. **Consistency**: Standardize naming across the APS framework to avoid ambiguity and confusion, ensuring all team members and AI tools use the same conventions.
3. **Machine Readability**: Integrate metadata into filenames to enhance compatibility with AI tools, scripts, and automation processes.
4. **Traceability and Compliance**: Maintain a clear record of document evolution, supporting governance and compliance requirements through standardized filenames.

## Key Components of Naming Conventions

### 1. **Metadata-Rich Filenames**

- **Format**: Filenames must follow a standardized format that includes key metadata elements to provide clear and immediate context.  
- **Standard Format**: <Component>_<Type>_<State>_<Role>_<Date>_<Version>_<Author>.<Extension>
  - **Component**: Indicates the part of the project (e.g., ProductDevelopment, CustomerSupport).
  - **Type**: Describes the document type (e.g., Context, KanbanBoard, SprintBacklog).
  - **State**: Specifies the current state of the document (e.g., Draft, InReview, Accepted).
  - **Role**: Defines the adversarial or non-adversarial role involved (e.g., APM for Adversarial Product Management, AT for Adversarial Testing).
  - **Date**: Uses YYYY-MM-DD format for the creation or last modification date.
  - **Version**: Follows the versioning strategy outlined in the APS (e.g., v1.0.0).
  - **Author**: Includes the initials or username of the document creator or owner.
  - **Extension**: Indicates the file format (e.g., md, yaml, json).

### 2. **Directory Naming**

- **Purpose**: Directories should use clear and descriptive names to reflect their content and purpose, aligning with the file naming conventions.
- **Standard Format**: <Category>-<Purpose>-<Date>  
  - **Category**: Describes the broad category of the directory (e.g., drafts, in-review, accepted).
  - **Purpose**: Specifies the focus or primary content of the directory (e.g., Pathway, Metrics).
  - **Date**: Optional, but useful for archiving directories by the relevant time period.

### 3. **Validation Tools for Enforcing Naming Standards**

- **Custom Scripts**: Scripts to automatically check that filenames and directories conform to the specified naming conventions.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Naming validation tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce standards during development and deployment.

## Best Practices for Naming Files and Directories

1. **Consistency**: Always adhere to the naming conventions specified in this context document to maintain consistency across the APS framework.
2. **Clarity**: Use descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose and content of the document or directory.
3. **Brevity**: Keep filenames concise while including all necessary metadata elements. Avoid overly long names that may be truncated or difficult to read.
4. **Automation-Friendly**: Use standardized formats to facilitate parsing and integration with automation tools and AI systems.
5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review naming conventions to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with evolving APS practices.

## Rationale for Naming Standards

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Clear, metadata-rich filenames and directories support effective communication among team members and AI tools.
2. **Improved Governance**: Standardized names contribute to better governance and compliance management by ensuring all documents are easily identifiable and traceable.
3. **Streamlined Automation**: Consistent naming conventions make it easier to automate processes, reducing manual overhead and the risk of errors.
4. **Scalable and Flexible**: The naming conventions are designed to accommodate future growth and changes, maintaining a structured approach even as the project evolves.

## Conclusion

The **Naming Conventions** within APS are integral to creating a cohesive and efficient document management system. By embedding essential metadata directly into filenames and directories, the conventions ensure that all APS documents are clearly identifiable, consistent, and machine-readable, facilitating both human and AI collaboration.

Adhering to these standards will enhance document retrieval, version control, and integration across agile processes, supporting continuous improvement and agile excellence.


The syntax has to support all of this
ChatGPT

Thought for 12 seconds

Certainly! Let's extend the APS Syntax to support all the requirements specified in the Naming Conventions Context module. This involves defining the syntax to represent naming conventions, metadata annotations, and integration with agile processes like SAFe, Scrum, Kanban, and others.

Extended APS Syntax to Support Naming Conventions and Agile Frameworks
The APS Syntax, being an extended version of Gherkin in YAML, can be enriched to capture the detailed metadata and naming conventions required for comprehensive documentation and automation within agile frameworks.

Key Objectives:
Integrate Naming Conventions: Embed metadata directly into the syntax to enforce naming standards.
Support Agile Frameworks: Represent SAFe, Scrum, Kanban, and other frameworks within the syntax.
Facilitate Machine Readability: Ensure the syntax is structured for easy parsing by AI tools and automation scripts.
Maintain Consistency and Clarity: Provide clear guidelines and examples for users to follow.

    - "JSON"
  conventions:
    - "Use metadata-rich filenames to convey essential information at a glance."
    - "Ensure that filenames are consistent, descriptive, and follow a standardized format."
    - "Incorporate state, version, date, author, and other relevant metadata into filenames."
2. Defining Naming Conventions
We can define the naming conventions as a part of the syntax, specifying the format and components.

yaml

naming_conventions:
  file_format: "<Component>_<Type>_<State>_<Role>_<Date>_<Version>_<Author>.<Extension>"
  components:
    - "Component": "Indicates the project part (e.g., ProductDevelopment)"
    - "Type": "Document type (e.g., Context, KanbanBoard)"
    - "State": "Current document state (e.g., Draft, InReview)"
    - "Role": "Role involved (e.g., APM for Adversarial Product Management)"
    - "Date": "Creation or modification date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
    - "Version": "Version number following semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0)"
    - "Author": "Initials or username of the creator"
    - "Extension": "File extension (e.g., md, yaml)"
  directory_format: "<Category>-<Purpose>-<Date>"
  examples:

import { useUserApi } from '@/composables/useUserApi';

const user = ref({ name: '', email: '', password: '' });
const { createUser } = useUserApi();

const submitForm = async () => {
  await createUser(user.value);
  // Handle success or error
};
</script>
5. Integrating AI Interactions
Adversarial Code Review with AI
AI Role:

AI Code Reviewer reviews code after implementation.
Integration:

Use AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CodeQL) integrated into the development workflow.
Set up automated code reviews using AI analysis.
Example:

After generating code using the CLI, the AI Code Reviewer can analyze the code for potential issues.

Steps:

Developer writes code or generates it using CLI commands.
AI Code Reviewer runs as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Feedback is provided in pull requests or as reports.
Assistance in Test Generation
AI Role:

AI Test Generator assists in creating test cases.
Integration:

Use AI tools to generate test cases based on code analysis.
Integrate with testing frameworks like ExUnit for Elixir or Jest for JavaScript.
Example Command:

Assuming the CLI supports test generation:

bash

planpro generate tests User --ai-assisted
Generated Test File (user_test.exs):

elixir

defmodule MyApp.Resources.UserTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  alias MyApp.Resources.User

  test "creates a user with valid data" do
    params = %{name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", password: "secret"}
    assert {:ok, %User{}} = MyApp.Api.create(User, params)
  end

  test "fails to create a user with missing email" do
    params = %{name: "John Doe", password: "secret"}
    assert {:error, _changeset} = MyApp.Api.create(User, params)
  end

  # Additional tests generated by AI...
end
6. Incorporating Code Blueprints into APS Syntax
To maintain alignment between the APS Syntax and the code artifacts, we can embed references to code blueprints and CLI commands within the APS tasks.

Updated Task Definition with Code Mapping
yaml

tasks:
  - id: "P2-T1"
    name: "Implement Ash Resources"
    description: "Develop backend resources using the Ash framework."
    assigned_to:
      - "Backend Developer"
    code_blueprints:
      - "Ash Resource Definitions for User, Post, Comment"
      - "Database Migrations"
      - "Policies for Authorization"
    cli_commands:
      - "planpro generate resource User --fields 'id:uuid,name:string,email:string,password_hash:string'"
      - "planpro generate migration CreateUser --fields 'id:uuid,name:string,email:string,password_hash:string'"
      - "planpro generate policy UserPolicy --resource User"
    interactions:
      - type: "Adversarial Review"
        with: "AI Code Reviewer"
        description: "AI reviews code for best practices and optimizations."
7. Automating Workflows with CLIAPI
The PLAN Pro CLI can be used to automate repetitive tasks and enforce consistency.

Example: Generating Resources for Multiple Models
Command:

bash

# Generate resources for multiple models using a script
planpro generate resources_from_file models.yml
models.yml File:

yaml

models:
  - name: "User"
    fields: "id:uuid,name:string,email:string,password_hash:string"
  - name: "Post"
    fields: "id:uuid,title:string,body:text,user_id:uuid"
  - name: "Comment"
    fields: "id:uuid,content:text,post_id:uuid,user_id:uuid"
Explanation:

The CLI reads models.yml and generates resources, migrations, and policies for each model.
8. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
GitHub Actions Workflow:

yaml

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set Up Elixir
        uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1
        with:
          elixir-version: '1.12'
          otp-version: '24.0'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: mix deps.get
      - name: Run Tests
        run: mix test
      - name: Run AI Code Review
        run: |
          # Assuming we have an AI tool installed
          ai-code-review .
      - name: Deploy Application
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          # Deployment commands
Explanation:

AI Code Review step runs the AI analysis tool.
Ensures code quality before deployment.
9. Ensuring Alignment with Business Requirements
By mapping APS tasks to code blueprints and CLIAPI commands, we ensure that the technical implementation aligns with the project's business requirements.

Example:

Business Requirement: Implement user authentication with secure password handling.
APS Task: Implement Ash Resources with password_hash attribute, enforce validations.
Code Blueprint: Ash resource with password_hash as a private attribute.
CLI Command: Generates the resource with necessary fields.
AI Interaction: AI Code Reviewer checks for security best practices.
10. Benefits of This Mapping
Efficiency: Automates code generation, reducing manual effort.
Consistency: Ensures code follows predefined templates and standards.
Quality Assurance: AI adversary coworkers help identify issues early.
Traceability: Maintains a clear link between planning and implementation.
Scalability: Easy to add new resources and components as the project grows.
Conclusion
By mapping the APS Syntax and project plan to code blueprints and CLIAPI commands, we bridge the gap between high-level planning and practical implementation. This approach:

Enables developers to rapidly scaffold code components aligned with the project requirements.
Leverages AI tools to enhance code quality and efficiency.
Maintains alignment between business objectives and technical execution.
Facilitates collaboration between human team members and AI adversary coworkers.
This comprehensive mapping ensures that the implementation of the PLAN Pro Stack is executed smoothly, efficiently, and in accordance with the planned timelines and objectives.

Robert's Rules of Order in YAML for Modeling Board Adversaries
Introduction
Robert's Rules of Order is a manual of parliamentary procedure that governs meetings and decision-making processes for organizations, including boards and committees. Modeling these rules in YAML allows for a structured, machine-readable representation of meetings, motions, debates, and voting procedures. This is particularly useful for creating systems where both human participants and AI adversarial coworkers interact within a board setting.

In this representation, we'll define:

  abstentions: 0
Minutes Recording
yaml

minutes:
  recorded_by: "Bob Smith"
  approvals_required: true
  approved_on: "2023-10-22"
Additional Roles and Permissions
yaml

permissions:
  Chairperson:
    can_call_to_order: true

rules_of_order:
  governing_document: "Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, 12th Edition"
  special_rules:
    - "AI participants may not vote."
    - "Debate time limits are strictly enforced."
    - "Motions require a second except where noted."
Implementing in APS Syntax
Given that APS Syntax is an extended Gherkin in YAML, we can model interactions and scenarios involving human and AI participants in the context of Robert's Rules.

Feature: Conducting a Board Meeting with AI Participation
yaml

feature:
  name: "Conduct Board Meeting with AI Participation"
  description: "Model a board meeting where both human members and AI adversaries participate under Robert's Rules of Order."
  participants:
    - name: "Alice Johnson"
      role: "Chairperson"
    - name: "Bob Smith"
      role: "Secretary"
    - name: "Carol Williams"
      role: "Board Member"
    - name: "David Lee"
      role: "Board Member"
    - name: "Eve Thompson"
      role: "Board Member"
    - name: "AI Advisor"
      role: "AI Adversary"
  scenarios:
    - name: "Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes"
      steps:
        - "Given the meeting is called to order by the Chairperson"
        - "And the previous minutes are distributed to all participants"
        - "When Carol Williams moves to approve the minutes"
        - "And David Lee seconds the motion"
        - "Then the motion is put to a voice vote"
        - "And the motion passes with majority approval"
    - name: "Debate on New Project Proposal"
      steps:
        - "Given David Lee proposes a new project"
        - "And the motion is seconded by Eve Thompson"
        - "When the Chairperson opens the floor for debate"
        - "Then the AI Advisor provides a risk assessment"
        - "And David Lee responds to the AI Advisor's concerns"
        - "When the debate concludes"
        - "Then the motion is put to a vote"
        - "And the motion passes with majority approval"
    - name: "AI Advisor Proposes an Amendment"
      steps:
        - "Given the AI Advisor proposes an amendment to modify the budget allocation"
        - "And the amendment is seconded by Carol Williams"
        - "When the Chairperson allows debate on the amendment"
        - "Then participants discuss the proposed changes"
        - "When the debate concludes"
        - "Then the amendment is put to a vote"
        - "And the amendment fails to pass"
Key Points in Modeling
AI Participants: Treated similarly to human participants but may have restrictions (e.g., cannot vote).
Motions and Amendments: Structured to include proposer, seconder, debate rules, and voting requirements.
Debate Rules: Clearly defined to manage the flow of discussion.
Voting Procedures: Specified to determine how decisions are made.
Potential Applications
Automated Meeting Management Systems: Software that can schedule meetings, manage agendas, and enforce rules of order.
AI Advisors in Decision-Making: Incorporating AI agents that provide data-driven insights during meetings.
Simulation and Training Tools: For teaching Robert's Rules and proper meeting conduct.
Compliance and Record-Keeping: Ensuring that meetings are conducted properly and minutes are accurately recorded.
Conclusion
By modeling Robert's Rules of Order in YAML, we create a structured representation of meeting procedures that can be used for automation, simulation, and enhanced decision-making. Including AI adversarial participants adds a layer of complexity that reflects modern organizational practices where AI systems contribute to discussions and provide valuable insights.

This YAML schema can be extended and customized to fit the specific needs of organizations, supporting both human and AI interactions within a formalized decision-making framework.

Next Steps
Customization: Adjust the schema to match your organization's bylaws and specific rules.
Integration: Implement this model within your APS Syntax to align with your agile processes.
Automation: Develop tools that can parse this YAML and facilitate meeting management, including scheduling, agenda preparation, and minute-taking.
AI Development: Enhance AI adversarial agents to participate meaningfully in meetings, providing analyses, risk assessments, and alternative viewpoints.

# Similarly, you can create instances for Project, Tasks, Roles, Interactions, and so on.

The above Pydantic models aim to capture the structure and components of the APS as discussed in our conversation. You can use these models to create instances representing specific modules, projects, meetings, tasks, and interactions, enabling validation, serialization, and further processing in Python applications.

Note: This is a synthesized representation and may need adjustments to fit specific use cases or to include additional details from the entire conversation context. Feel free to extend or modify these models to suit your needs.

I’m gathering info on the user's request to create Pydantic models for APS, ensuring descriptive field names and avoiding repetitive documentation.

Enhancing field descriptions

I’m updating Pydantic models to boost field descriptions, avoiding repetitious class-level docstrings. This involves focusing on modules, naming conventions, roles, tasks, interactions, workflows, and meetings.

Compiling Pydantic models

I’m pulling together Pydantic models, detailing fields with descriptions using Field(..., description=...). This approach enriches model clarity and fosters understanding.

Integrating elements

I’m working through an updated Pydantic models setup, ensuring correct interconnections and detailed field descriptions. Forward references simplify nested model integration.

Certainly! Below are the comprehensive Pydantic models for the Adversarial Agile Protocol Specification (APS), synthesized from our entire conversation. Each model inherits from dspygen.utils.dsl_tools.DSLModel and includes well-described fields using Field(..., description="..."). The class docstrings provide the rationale ("Why") for each model without repeating field details, ensuring adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Explanation of the Models
RoleType & InteractionType Enums: Enumerations to restrict the values for role types and interaction types, ensuring consistency across the models.

RelatedModule: Represents modules related to a specific module, including their names and file paths.

NamingConventions: Defines the standards for naming files and directories, including formats, components, and examples.

ValidationRule & ValidationTool: Capture the rules and tools used to validate naming conventions or other standards within APS.

QualityAssurance: Details the frameworks and thresholds for ensuring quality within the APS.

BusinessRequirements: Outlines the key features, target audience, and success metrics aligning technical implementations with business goals.

Development & Deployment: Provide guidelines and configurations for setting up development environments and deployment processes.

Metadata: Encapsulates metadata information relevant to various entities within APS.

Interaction: Models interactions between different roles, specifying the type, involved roles, and descriptions.

Subtask & Task: Represent tasks and their hierarchical subtasks, including assignments, dependencies, interactions, and additional details like estimated time and priority.

Workflow: Defines the workflow type and the sequence or parallelism of tasks.

Role: Defines the roles involved in the project, whether human or AI, along with their responsibilities.

Project: Aggregates all roles, tasks, and workflows associated with a project, providing a comprehensive overview.

Amendment, Debate, Motion, Action: Model the components of meeting procedures, capturing the dynamics of motions, debates, and actions taken during meetings.

AgendaItem: Represents items on a meeting's agenda, including actions and possible sub-items.

Participant: Lists participants in meetings, along with their roles.

Meeting: Encapsulates the details of a meeting, including participants, agenda, and rules of order.

Feature: Represents features within the project, detailing involved roles, participants, naming conventions, metadata, and scenarios.

Module: Central to defining a module within APS, capturing related modules, naming conventions, validation rules, tools, business requirements, and other configurations.

Integration with DSLModel
All models inherit from DSLModel, which provides serialization and deserialization capabilities between Pydantic models and YAML/JSON formats. This inheritance ensures that instances of these models can be easily saved to or loaded from files, facilitating seamless integration with various tools and processes within the APS framework.

Usage Example
Here's how you can create instances of these models and utilize their serialization capabilities:

python

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The Command-Line Interface Application Programming Interface (CLIAPI) is introduced as a standardized specification language for defining and documenting command-line interfaces (CLIs), analogous to how OpenAPI standardizes RESTful APIs. CLIAPI aims to enhance the development, integration, and maintenance of CLI tools by providing a machine-readable format that facilitates automation, validation, and interoperability. This paper presents the motivations behind CLIAPI, its core design principles, the specification structure, and potential use cases. By drawing parallels with OpenAPI, CLIAPI seeks to bring similar benefits to the realm of command-line utilities, fostering a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are fundamental tools in software development, system administration, and various other domains. They provide users with powerful means to interact with software through textual commands, offering flexibility and efficiency that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) may lack. However, the absence of a standardized specification language for CLIs poses challenges in areas such as documentation, automation, and interoperability.

OpenAPI has revolutionized the way RESTful APIs are documented and consumed by providing a clear, machine-readable specification. Inspired by this success, we propose CLIAPI—a specification language tailored for defining and documenting CLIs. CLIAPI aims to bridge the gap by offering a structured format that encapsulates the functionalities, commands, options, and behaviors of CLI tools, thereby enhancing their usability and integration.

\section{Motivation}
The proliferation of CLI tools across various platforms necessitates a standardized approach to their definition and documentation. Current practices often involve ad-hoc documentation, making it difficult to automate tasks such as generating help messages, integrating with other tools, or validating command structures. A formal specification like CLIAPI can address these issues by providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consistency}: Ensures uniformity in how CLIs are defined and documented.
    \item \textbf{Automation}: Facilitates the generation of documentation, help commands, and even code scaffolding.
    \item \textbf{Interoperability}: Enables seamless integration between different CLI tools and other software components.
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Allows for automated testing and validation of CLI commands and options.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
While OpenAPI has established a robust framework for API specifications, the CLI ecosystem lacks a comparable standard. Existing efforts to document CLIs typically involve Markdown files, man pages, or custom help outputs. Tools like \texttt{argparse} for Python and \texttt{Commander.js} for Node.js provide mechanisms to define CLI behaviors, but they do not offer a standardized, interoperable specification format.

Other related works include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Docopt}: A tool that helps define command-line interfaces by writing the help message first.
    \item \textbf{Yargs}: A library for building interactive command-line tools with Node.js.
    \item \textbf{Clikt}: A Kotlin library for creating command-line interfaces.
\end{itemize}

However, none of these provide a universal specification language akin to OpenAPI.

\section{CLIAPI Specification}
CLIAPI is designed to be a declarative, machine-readable specification language for CLIs. It leverages YAML for its readability and ease of use, similar to OpenAPI.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are integral to modern software development, system administration, and various other domains. Despite their ubiquity, there lacks a standardized specification language akin to OpenAPI for RESTful APIs, which hinders automation, integration, and consistency across CLI tools. This paper introduces CLIAPI, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to standardize the definition, documentation, and validation of CLIs. We conduct a comprehensive review of major CLIs, including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CLI, and others, analyzing their structures, features, and design principles. Based on this analysis, we outline the requirements and design considerations necessary for CLIAPI to effectively support these diverse CLIs. Furthermore, we discuss the potential benefits, challenges, and future directions for CLIAPI, positioning it as a transformative tool for enhancing CLI development and interoperability.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) serve as powerful tools for interacting with software applications, offering flexibility and efficiency that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) may not provide. They are extensively used in software development, system administration, data analysis, and automation. However, the absence of a standardized specification language for CLIs poses challenges in areas such as documentation, automation, interoperability, and maintenance.

OpenAPI has revolutionized the way RESTful APIs are documented and consumed by providing a clear, machine-readable specification. Inspired by this success, we propose CLIAPI—a specification language tailored for defining and documenting CLIs. CLIAPI aims to bridge the gap by offering a structured format that encapsulates the functionalities, commands, options, and behaviors of CLI tools, thereby enhancing their usability, integration, and maintainability.

    \item \textbf{Cmdliner}: An OCaml library for declaratively defining command-line interfaces.
\end{itemize}

However, none of these provide a universal specification language akin to OpenAPI, limiting their applicability across diverse CLI tools and hindering automation and integration efforts.

# 20240427Q Paper: CLIAPI Comprehensive Review

**Title:**  
CLIAPI: A Comprehensive Specification Framework for Command-Line Interfaces Inspired by OpenAPI

**Authors:**  
Jane Doe, John Smith

**Abstract:**  
Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are integral to modern software development, system administration, and various other domains. Despite their ubiquity, there lacks a standardized specification language akin to OpenAPI for RESTful APIs, which hinders automation, integration, and consistency across CLI tools. This paper introduces CLIAPI, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to standardize the definition, documentation, and validation of CLIs. We conduct a comprehensive review of major CLIs, including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CLI, and others, analyzing their structures, features, and design principles. Based on this analysis, we outline the requirements and design considerations necessary for CLIAPI to effectively support these diverse CLIs. Furthermore, we discuss the potential benefits, challenges, and future directions for CLIAPI, positioning it as a transformative tool for enhancing CLI development and interoperability.

**Introduction:**  
Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) serve as powerful tools for interacting with software applications, offering flexibility and efficiency that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) may not provide. They are extensively used in software development, system administration, data analysis, and automation. However, the absence of a standardized specification language for CLIs poses challenges in areas such as documentation, automation, interoperability, and maintenance.

OpenAPI has revolutionized the way RESTful APIs are documented and consumed by providing a clear, machine-readable specification. Inspired by this success, we propose CLIAPI—a specification language tailored for defining and documenting CLIs. CLIAPI aims to bridge the gap by offering a structured format that encapsulates the functionalities, commands, options, and behaviors of CLI tools, thereby enhancing their usability, integration, and maintainability.

**Background and Related Work:**  
While OpenAPI has established a robust framework for API specifications, the CLI ecosystem lacks a comparable standard. Existing efforts to document CLIs typically involve Markdown files, man pages, or custom help outputs. Tools like \texttt{argparse} for Python and \texttt{Commander.js} for Node.js provide mechanisms to define CLI behaviors, but they do not offer a standardized, interoperable specification format.

Other related works include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Docopt}: A tool that helps define command-line interfaces by writing the help message first.
    \item \textbf{Yargs}: A library for building interactive command-line tools with Node.js.
    \item \textbf{Clikt}: A Kotlin library for creating command-line interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Cmdliner}: An OCaml library for declaratively defining command-line interfaces.
\end{itemize}

However, none of these provide a universal specification language akin to OpenAPI, limiting their applicability across diverse CLI tools and hindering automation and integration efforts.

# 20240427S Specification: CLIAPI Detailed Structure

**Description:**  
CLIAPI is designed to be a declarative, machine-readable specification language for CLIs, leveraging YAML for its readability and structure. This specification outlines the core components, syntax rules, and design principles necessary to define, document, and validate CLI tools effectively.

**Core Components:**
1. **Metadata**
   - **Fields:**
     - `name`: The name of the CLI tool.
     - `version`: The current version of the CLI tool.
     - `description`: A brief description of the CLI tool's purpose.
     - `author`: The author or maintainer of the CLI tool.

2. **Commands**
   - **Fields:**
     - `name`: The name of the command.
     - `description`: A description of what the command does.
     - `options`: A list of options (flags) associated with the command.
     - `arguments`: A list of positional arguments required by the command.
     - `subcommands`: A list of nested subcommands under the command.
     - `examples`: A list of example usages for the command.

3. **Options**
   - **Fields:**
     - `name`: The name of the option (e.g., `--force`).
     - `description`: A description of what the option does.
     - `type`: The data type of the option (e.g., `boolean`, `string`, `integer`).
     - `required`: Indicates whether the option is mandatory.
     - `default`: The default value if the option is not provided.

4. **Arguments**
   - **Fields:**
     - `name`: The name of the argument.
     - `description`: A description of the argument.
     - `required`: Indicates whether the argument is mandatory.
     - `type`: The data type of the argument.

5. **Subcommands**
   - **Fields:**
     - `name`: The name of the subcommand.
     - `description`: A description of what the subcommand does.
     - `options`: A list of options specific to the subcommand.
     - `arguments`: A list of positional arguments specific to the subcommand.
     - `examples`: A list of example usages for the subcommand.

6. **Examples**
   - **Fields:**
     - `examples`: A list of example command usages demonstrating how to use the command and its options.

**Syntax Rules:**
- **Hierarchy:** Commands can have nested subcommands, allowing for a hierarchical command structure.
- **Consistency:** All commands, options, and arguments must follow a consistent naming and structuring convention.
- **Validation:** Specifications must be validated against the CLIAPI schema to ensure correctness and adherence to standards.

**Example CLIAPI Specification:**
```yaml
cliapi:
  metadata:
    name: "ExampleCLI"
    version: "1.0.0"
    description: "A sample CLI tool for demonstration purposes."
    author: "Jane Doe"
  commands:
    - name: "init"
      description: "Initialize a new project."
      options:
        - name: "--force"
          description: "Force initialization even if the directory is not empty."
          type: "boolean"
          required: false
          default: false
      arguments:
        - name: "directory"
          description: "The directory to initialize."
          required: true
          type: "string"
      examples:
        - "examplecli init ./my-project"
        - "examplecli init ./my-project --force"
    - name: "build"
      description: "Build the project."
      options:
        - name: "--prod"
          description: "Build for production."
          type: "boolean"
          required: false
          default: false
      subcommands:
        - name: "clean"
          description: "Clean build artifacts."
          options: []
          arguments: []
          examples:
            - "examplecli build clean"
      examples:
        - "examplecli build"
        - "examplecli build --prod"
Design Principles:

Human and Machine Readability: Leveraging YAML ensures that specifications are easy to read and write for humans while being easily parsable by machines.
Extensibility: CLIAPI is designed to accommodate a wide range of CLI tools, from simple utilities to complex, multi-level command structures.
Consistency: A uniform structure across all CLIAPI specifications ensures that tools and integrations can reliably interpret and interact with any CLI tool defined using CLIAPI.
Interoperability: By providing a standardized format, CLIAPI facilitates interoperability between different CLI tools and other software systems, enabling seamless integrations and automation.

\begin{abstract}
    Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) remain a cornerstone of software development, system administration, and various technical domains due to their efficiency and flexibility. Despite their prevalence, the lack of a standardized specification language analogous to OpenAPI for RESTful APIs presents challenges in documentation, automation, and interoperability. This paper introduces CLIAPI, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to standardize the definition, documentation, and validation of CLIs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CLIAPI, delineating its advanced features such as plugin support, marketplace integration, TOGAF framework commands, and robust configuration management. Additionally, we identify existing gaps within CLIAPI that hinder its adoption and effectiveness, providing recommendations for future enhancements. By bridging the specification gap for CLIs, CLIAPI aims to foster a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are integral tools in various technical fields, offering users the ability to perform complex tasks with precision and speed. Tools such as Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CLI exemplify the power and versatility of CLIs. However, the absence of a standardized specification language for CLIs limits their documentation quality, automation potential, and interoperability. OpenAPI has successfully addressed these issues for RESTful APIs by providing a machine-readable format that facilitates automation, validation, and integration. Inspired by this success, we introduce CLIAPI—a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) aimed at standardizing the definition and documentation of CLIs.

\section{CLIAPI Overview}
CLIAPI is designed to be a comprehensive specification framework for CLIs, enabling developers to define commands, options, arguments, plugins, extensions, and other advanced features in a structured and machine-readable format. By leveraging YAML, CLIAPI ensures both human readability and machine parseability, facilitating automation and integration with various tools and platforms.

\subsection{Core Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Command Structure}: Supports nested commands and subcommands, mirroring the complexity of modern CLIs.
    \item \textbf{Extensive Option Definitions}: Allows for the definition of global and command-specific options with data types, defaults, and validation rules.
    \item \textbf{Plugin and Extension Support}: Facilitates the integration of plugins and extensions, enabling the extension of CLI functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Marketplace Integration}: Provides specifications for marketplace interactions, including browsing and installing plugins/extensions.
    \item \textbf{TOGAF Framework Commands}: Incorporates commands aligned with the TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) for enterprise architecture management.
    \item \textbf{Configuration Management}: Defines global and repository-specific configurations, supporting environment variables and settings management.
    \item \textbf{Alias and Shortcut Definitions}: Enables the creation and management of command aliases for improved usability.
    \item \textbf{Versioning and Compatibility}: Incorporates version control within specifications to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.
    \item \textbf{Interactive Prompts and Conditional Operations}: Supports the definition of interactive elements within CLI operations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of CLIAPI Features}
In this section, we evaluate the advanced features of CLIAPI by mapping them against prominent CLIs such as Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CLI. This evaluation highlights CLIAPI's capabilities in capturing the complexity and extensibility of modern CLIs.

Modern CLIs like Git and Docker support plugins and extensions to enhance functionality. CLIAPI's specification allows for the definition of plugins and extensions as subcommands with their own options and arguments.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Git}: Supports plugins for custom commands.
    \item \textbf{Docker}: Utilizes extensions for additional functionalities.
    \item \textbf{CLIAPI}: Enables detailed specification of plugins and extensions, including installation, removal, listing, and updating processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Marketplace Integration}
The integration with a marketplace allows users to discover and install plugins/extensions seamlessly. CLIAPI includes specifications for marketplace commands such as browsing, searching, and installing items.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GitHub CLI}: Integrates with GitHub Marketplace for plugins.
    \item \textbf{Docker CLI}: Accesses Docker Hub for extensions.
    \item \textbf{CLIAPI}: Defines marketplace interaction commands, supporting filters, sorting, and installation from specified sources.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TOGAF Framework Commands}
Enterprise architecture management often relies on frameworks like TOGAF. CLIAPI incorporates commands that align with TOGAF principles, facilitating architecture definition, analysis, and repository management.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)}: Manages cluster architectures.
    \item \textbf{Terraform CLI}: Implements infrastructure as code aligned with architectural frameworks.
    \item \textbf{CLIAPI}: Provides a structured approach to defining TOGAF-aligned commands, supporting domain definitions and compliance analyses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuration Management}
Effective configuration management is crucial for maintaining consistent CLI behaviors across environments. CLIAPI supports the definition of global and repository-specific configurations, including environment variables and default settings.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AWS CLI}: Utilizes profiles and environment variables for configuration.
    \item \textbf{Git CLI}: Manages configurations at global and repository levels.
    \item \textbf{CLIAPI}: Facilitates comprehensive configuration definitions, supporting inheritance and overrides.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alias and Shortcut Definitions}
Aliases enhance usability by allowing users to create shortcuts for frequently used commands. CLIAPI includes specifications for creating, managing, and listing aliases.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Git CLI}: Supports command aliases for streamlined workflows.
    \item \textbf{CLIAPI}: Defines alias commands with support for creation, deletion, and listing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Identification of Gaps in CLIAPI}
While CLIAPI presents a robust framework for CLI specification, certain gaps limit its current effectiveness and adoption. Addressing these gaps is essential for CLIAPI to fully realize its potential.

\subsection{Dynamic Command Generation}
\textbf{Gap}: Modern CLIs often support dynamic command generation based on runtime contexts or configurations. CLIAPI currently lacks mechanisms to define dynamic commands that adapt based on user input or environment states.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Introduce a syntax for conditional command definitions and dynamic parameter assignments to support adaptive CLI behaviors.

\subsection{Interactive and Non-Deterministic Operations}
\textbf{Gap}: Some CLI operations involve interactive prompts or non-deterministic outcomes based on user interactions. CLIAPI does not currently provide specifications for defining interactive elements within commands.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Develop a specification framework within CLIAPI to define interactive prompts, conditional flows, and user-driven decision points within CLI commands.

\subsection{Enhanced Validation Rules}
\textbf{Gap}: CLIAPI supports basic data types and validation, but lacks advanced validation rules such as regex patterns, range constraints, and cross-field dependencies.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Expand the validation capabilities in CLIAPI to include regex-based validations, numerical ranges, and conditional dependencies between options and arguments.

\subsection{Comprehensive Tooling Support}
\textbf{Gap}: The effectiveness of CLIAPI is heavily reliant on supporting tooling such as validators, documentation generators, and code scaffolding tools. Currently, there is limited tooling available to fully leverage CLIAPI specifications.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Invest in the development of a comprehensive suite of CLIAPI tools, including IDE plugins, automated validators, and integration modules for CI/CD pipelines to enhance usability and adoption.

\subsection{Versioning and Compatibility Management}
\textbf{Gap}: While CLIAPI includes versioning support, it lacks detailed mechanisms for managing backward compatibility and handling deprecated commands or options.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Implement a versioning schema within CLIAPI that allows for deprecation notices, backward compatibility flags, and migration paths to facilitate seamless transitions between CLIAPI versions.

\subsection{Extensibility for Diverse CLI Paradigms}
\textbf{Gap}: CLIAPI is designed with a generic approach, but some CLIs follow unique paradigms or specialized workflows that CLIAPI may not fully accommodate.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Introduce extensibility points within CLIAPI specifications, such as custom command attributes or plugin hooks, to support specialized CLI paradigms without compromising the core standardization.

\section{Discussion}
CLIAPI offers a promising solution to the lack of standardized CLI specifications by introducing a structured, machine-readable format that encapsulates the complexity and extensibility of modern CLIs. Its support for advanced features like plugins, marketplace integration, and configuration management positions it as a versatile tool for developers and organizations aiming to enhance their CLI tools' usability and interoperability.

However, the identified gaps highlight areas where CLIAPI can evolve to better serve the diverse needs of CLI tool developers. By addressing dynamic command generation, interactive operations, enhanced validation, comprehensive tooling, and extensibility, CLIAPI can significantly improve its adoption and effectiveness.

\section{Conclusion}
CLIAPI represents a significant advancement in the standardization of Command-Line Interfaces, drawing inspiration from the success of OpenAPI in the API domain. Its comprehensive feature set addresses many of the current challenges faced in CLI documentation and automation. Nonetheless, addressing the identified gaps is crucial for CLIAPI to achieve widespread adoption and to fully support the evolving landscape of CLI tools. Future work will focus on enhancing CLIAPI's specification capabilities, developing robust tooling, and engaging the developer community to refine and expand the framework.

all right
hi everybody uh thanks so much for
joining me today i'm going to be talking
about
designing for the command line um so
first i just thought i'd start off with
i'm talking about just what is it
exactly that a command line interface
is so anytime um you're
What is a command line interface?
interacting with your computer you're
really just kind of telling it to do
something
and a command line tool is how you tell
it to do something using text instead of
clicking a button
um i think it's really helpful to
remember that this is what computers
used to be they were really only text
interfaces they were
just terminals and this is what
computers were like
when unix was being created and unix
is the operating system that's the basis
for a lot of
the basic concepts that we take for
granted today
and one of those concepts is the nested
file system
so very well familiar with this but
relatively quickly
from those text interfaces we move to
using these kinds of graphic interfaces
they're what we call gui's
but that original text interface the
command line still exists
and is used today so this is the text
version of what it is you just saw
so this means change directory or folder
into the github cli folder and then list
the contents of that folder so really
all cli
r is a way to interact with your
computer and the files on them
so unix comes with all of these out of
the box commands
uh you just saw cd and ls
and while these commands are all really
powerful and foundational
they can be really hard to understand
there's not a consistency to how they're
named
and it's not very obvious um what they
are or what they do
or how you might use them so just to
give you a sense of
what these commands look like um so if
you write cat
with the file name like what would you
maybe expect this to do
um it actually at its most basic just
outputs the contents of that file uh cat
stands for concatenate um
grep is how you search for strings
within a file and greps
actually stands for global regular
expression print
so these are just terms that you kind of
have to just learn
so that would just output that line that
matched that string i passed it
and rm means remove or delete so this is
how
i would delete this file and that
actually just outputs nothing
um which is pretty boring right uh
because unix
follows this principle called no news is
good news
so basically if everything goes fine
just say nothing
so a lot of that design was intended to
limit the amount of characters that were
being used because screens at the time
were small
and keyboards uh could be uncomfortable
to type on so
um and some of these commands are
actually so obscure
that they were literally just inside
jokes uh from berkeley or bell labs
back in the 70s i think this one might
be a little bit of an urban legend
but you can see that uh this command
biff
was actually just named after someone's
dog who used to bark at the mailman
so i don't think that this command is
used very frequently anymore but i think
this really illustrates
um how these things were happening and i
think it's also important to note that i
don't think these commands
were being designed with like this this
kind of longevity in mind they didn't
realize how popular or how long-standing
these commands would end up being
so these problems actually existed
already back in the in the early 80s
as unix was becoming more popular so
this is a
um article that um don norman the author
of everyday things wrote
before he even published um his book um
and he criticizes a lot of these things
that i've been talking about
and at large like these things really
still exist today because
we really did move on to graphic
interfaces and the terminal kind of got
left behind
and that brings me to git in addition to
these out-of-the-box
unix commands uh people make additional
command line tools so you could think of
them kind of like
apps for your terminal and so git is a
version control tool and that is what
github is powered on
so as a command line tool you can see
that git is an improvement on these out
of the box commands and that it uses
whole words
um but this is still kind of confusing
so what do these words mean what does
rebase mean what does commit mean
and these are concepts that you have to
learn outside of just memorizing these
commands to use in a certain order
so this is actually um a quote from a
parody interview so this is not a real
quote just to be very clear
um but this is a quote from a parody
interview with linus torvalds who's the
creator of git i saw this quote floating
around the internet a lot and it took a
lot of work for me to figure out that
this was not a real quote which i think
says something about how it resonates
i'm just using this to say that a lot of
people really struggle with these
concepts
and they really always assume it's their
fault or like they're not a real
developer because these things are hard
to learn
but it's not it's really just that these
things really weren't designed to be
simple to pick up
but so all of this said people do
use command line tools for a reason and
they've persisted in their current form
for a reason i think this really boils
down to the fact that it's really the
ultimate power tool it's
interacting with your computer without
any guard rails and you can do whatever
you want with that
so things that people love um people
love
uh being able to automate really tedious
tasks
um they can move really fast because of
that it's very flexible you can compose
these different commands together string
them together to do what you want
and i think people also really value um
the experience of using the terminal so
they build up a muscle map muscle memory
to go really fast they don't have to
take their hands off the keyboards and
you always have a history of actions
above you
and i think a little bit you get to feel
like a hacker in a 90s movie
but something i like to think about a
lot is just how much people really like
to learn
in general but i think especially on
github because they come to github
to code and to collaborate with other
developers and these are really
important skills to have
so if we assume that this is what a
learning curve looks like for these
things today
we i really think that we can make these
things easier to learn
without necessarily oversimplifying them
so people are more than capable of
learning hard things and they should but
there's so much we can do to make these
things less obscure and less arcane
so you could argue that that's all fine
because
people who are novices prefer graphic
interfaces anyway
and people who are advanced developers
just will pick up
command line tools with no problem but i
think maybe this is true in a really
large strokes but i don't think it's
it's more accurate to say
that people really do just feel safe and
trust
whatever it is they were they were
taught first so i've talked to a lot of
advanced developers who prefer
using graphic tools because they're like
why would i not just click on a button
if i can click on a button
and i talk to a lot of beginner to
intermediate folks who
prefer command line tools because that's
what they were taught and that's what
they're comfortable with now
and of course it's always important to
remember that everyone is a beginner at
some point
that brings me to making vh github cli
gh is a tool that sits alongside git and
fun fact it did actually come out of
beta this morning
so that's exciting um
when i talk to a lot of people about my
work i get questions like what is it
exactly that you're designing like what
do you do
day to day so just to make that super
clear up front
um what i design is the commands we
should make so together with my team
we thought that it would be really
valuable for people to be able to list
their issues from the command line
so we decided that that command would be
named
gha2list with the filter state closed
we decided what that would output so it
would show the list
with things in red with the columns um
and we also decide how people discover
them so how can we help people know
to open up a blank terminal and know how
to type gh issue list
so taking a step back just our overall
goals with the project
uh we wanted to bring github concepts to
the terminal so there's a lot of
concepts
within github that don't exist in git
Our goals
and we wanted to enable people to be
able to script and automate with those
things
and we also really wanted to reduce
context switching between
the terminal and the and the website the
github website so this is a
quick overview of just what it can look
like day to day for a developer to move
between github.com and the terminal
so this might not seem like that big of
a deal but i really think it's similar
to the phenomenon of when you walk
through a door
and you like totally forgot why you went
in that room in the first place
and so that friction really adds up over
time and
we saw um just a really a great
opportunity to bring all of these things
together
so while we might not build every single
thing that exists on github we saw a lot
of value in letting you do your core
things from where you already are
so like i mentioned earlier these are
things that people love
and so these are the things we wanted
the size in anything we design
and these are the things that we can't
get in the way of when we're designing
as well
and these are the things that we want to
mitigate so there's a total lack of
affordances
uh command line tools can be really
unforgiving of mistakes even for
advanced developers like you hit the
command and there's
it just deletes something and there's no
way to undo that so it's kind of scary
sometimes to work with it
it relies on memory a lot there's all
these commands that you have to keep in
your head all the time and memorize and
different command line tools do it in
different ways
and overall it just really makes you
think a lot
so i think this feeling is really
encapsulated by this like
you open up a blank terminal and you
just have this cursor just kind of
mocking you
so uh when you're designing anything
visually these are really the variables
you have at your disposal
you and we really do have most of these
things when we're designing for the
command line
we still have color we still have space
we don't have type size because all
of the type is the same size but we can
format things and make them bold we can
add icons through unicode we definitely
don't have images
but we do have language which i think is
our most important tool
so early on when i was designing uh i
really wanted to just get a sense of
what was possible so i spent some time
looking for just the absolute wackiest
command line tools i could possibly find
and this one is my favorite so
this is actually a globe that someone
made in the terminal and this act just
totally
blew up away like any sense of what i
thought was possible
um and i think it's really cool to see
that despite the fact that there's no
images
in the command line this person was able
to create a map of the entire world
i also spent some time looking for games
that people make on the command line
so this is a typing test that someone
made
and i just really loved this as an
example of a really clear and simple
interface that's still fun so this was
another great example to help me just
understand what constraints i was
working with
Generating possibilities
so after gathering all that inspiration
i worked together with my team
to generate as many possibilities as we
could and go as wide as we wanted
and we actually did that in google docs
so it turns out if you
make the background black and use a
monospace font google docs really feels
like terminal
so this was a great opportunity for us
to figure out together
what we wanted to do and what we didn't
want to do
and how interactive we wanted to get and
how we wanted to talk to our users
and you can see in our comments here it
was a really great way for us to discuss
right in line what it was that we liked
what we didn't
and this is really how we nailed down
what we thought the interaction of this
tool should be
so this is actually still what i use
today um i have this template that has
kind of like our loose
design system in it and this is how this
is my jumping off point for any tool
um and we still use this today i really
hope that we can actually open source
this so that our open source
contributors can use this to
um share their ideas with us so these
are just some
higher fidelity designs that i've done
recently
so to give you a sense of what we made
um so what it what life is like with gh
What we made
and without gh
so right now when you're checking out
someone else's pull request or when
you're reviewing their code
basically you have to use these few
different git commands and no one can
ever remember them
i've talked to a lot of people who
complain that they always need to google
it every time they need to do it and now
we have that
as just one simple command
um to clone someone else's project
um right now you need to go to the
project you need to copy the url
and then you can clone that project and
go back to the terminal do that and if
you know the project name you can
actually now do that just
in wall line gh brings just the entire
concept of issues to the command line
so issues don't exist at all in git so
that now you can
create issues list issues view issues
all right from where you already are
and lastly when you're creating a
project
right now it's pretty annoying because
you have to create it locally in your
terminal and then you have to go
to the website connect the two things
and now again you can just do that in
one line
so i think the biggest thing that i
learned is that
designing for the command line is really
the same as designing for anything else
we so we have those design constraints i
talked about
um and just to give you a sense of what
it's like to
use these design constraints so that say
this is some raw output
this is what it's like to add space um
this is what it's like to make some
things bold so you can already see
there's some
hierarchy building up adding color
and adding some icons so i think you can
really see how just using a light touch
with these
variables you can make outputs so much
easier to look at and
easier to understand
um so people also that's not so people
also
just customize all of these things so
people customize their colors
their fonts they can make aliases so
they can just completely rename
the commands that you made for them so
that same command i just showed you this
is what it might look like in someone
else's terminal
the concept of home so any product is
going to have a concept
like some kind of landing experience so
this is ours
so this is what we call a help page and
this is
um how we give people a jumping point to
explore the rest of the tool and read
about it and understand
what it does um so we make sure that
this is really concise and easy to
understand
so that people can from the get go just
learn
and explore on their own we think about
accessibility
we worked with some consultants who work
with github and one of my favorite
things
we learn from them is that when someone
is using voiceover and
reading this a bunch of spaces
don't actually read as a pause so right
now
this line would read as issue create and
view issues which doesn't make sense as
a sentence it's really hard to
understand
so we add colons and colons more
reliably
read as a pause so this now will read as
issue create and view issues and so now
that's a lot easier to understand
as a sentence we think about
discoverability
so discoverability is probably the
toughest thing to deal with on the
command line
but i think the way we get around that
is having a really clear and consistent
language system
designing this early really allowed us
to find holes in our own system
so for example like we decided to not
use the word open
because open could be misconstrued as
open an issue
or open in the browser so we decided to
just use that and stuck with using
create or or view instead
um and i think the most important part
of this is that it helps people memorize
and it helps people predict how things
work across the whole tool
and all of this also exists on our docs
site so you can
peruse that at your own leisure
apologies if you can hear any noise in
the background i have a parrot who's
screaming
um but anyway um i designed
also a way for people to go from the
website
down locally so these are
ways for people to introduce themselves
to the tool and also
it's ways for us to teach you a little
bit about how the tool works
we try to encourage good behavior so
this is something i actually worry about
a lot in our tool so
if you strip away all of the context um
from github
um like avatars and people's names and
we also make it easy for people to move
faster and script things
how can we still encourage people to you
know behave well on our platform
um a small way we do that is by adding
issue templates
to any creation flow so these are really
important for project maintainers
because it helps
people write good issues so we make sure
to include that step
from the command line as well
and i think just overall making things
simpler and easier just helps people
follow best practices a little better
so the principle of no news is good news
that i mentioned at the beginning this
is actually a rule that we decided to
bend or even break because
we are you know working on modern
computers with modern keyboards so we
thought that that was a good
reason for us to be able to be a little
more verbose
than most command line tools so we do
actually show success messages so
there's no
experience where you hit it and then
just nothing happens and it's weird and
you don't know what happened
so we do show a success message lets you
know that the thing that you wanted to
do did happen
and you're in this new state we also
show
some context setting headers so before
we added these people would do things
like
create pull requests in the wrong
repository or they wouldn't really know
what list they were looking at
so i think these headers really just
help you
like know where you are and know what
you're doing and it's a really helpful
way for
you to just think a little less
understand what's going on and make you
feel a little more secure in what it is
you're doing
for riskier actions that are difficult
to undo we make sure to include a
confirmation step
so i think all of these things together
just contribute to a sense of comfort
and
a sense that we're looking out for you
so preferences we don't necessarily have
like a setting cog in the corner
um but we do have a config file where
you can set preferences like your
preferred editor
we think about consistency so i think a
lot of what we do is just make its tool
feel familiar with what you already know
on github.com
so if you're familiar with github you
know that these colors really hold a lot
of meaning
so open is always green closed means red
merged means purple and we make sure to
reflect all of those locally as well
same here so you're for a pull request
you're always looking for
have my checks passed have my have money
has my code review passed
and we also reflect that state as
closely as we can as well
in general just a list of closed issues
will
still look and feel like a list of
closed issues
and we reflect flows as well that people
are familiar with
so if you merge a pull request you just
select the method
confirm it and then you can delete the
branch
and this is how we reflect that flow in
the tool so you
select the method um you can delete the
branch
not just on github now but also locally
and you see those
messages and their respective colors
that you're familiar with
we also asked for feedback so um in that
help page i showed you earlier
we have a few ways that we um like ask
you to
let us know like what you're thinking
and so we have this feedback form that
we've gotten a really a ton of really
awesome
really helpful feedback from and we also
prompt you to open an issue in our
repository using
the tool itself which makes me which
makes me smile
um this is just an example of my
favorite feedback that we've ever gotten
this just makes me laugh and i put it in
every presentation um we think about
surprise and delight uh we have had some
really fun hack days
and one of my favorite projects that
came out of that was this hack day
project by nate smith
and he made this project called repo
garden
and this actually makes a generates a
garden from the commencing your
repository
so i just think this is absolutely
beautiful
so it's kind of like a text adventure
where you're walking around this garden
and exploring the commits
in your project
lastly this tool is all open source so
this
is an example of me doing design review
with a contributor recently
and yeah lastly just designing for text
only interface really forced us to be
creative under all of these constraints
that i talked about today
and i'll leave you with this uh what
would the text only version be
of whatever it is you're designing i
hope it'll help you learn something new
or it'll help you see the problem with
new eyes because it definitely did that
for me
and as a final treat this is a command
called
gh credits another hack day project by
nate
and this is just a big thank you to all
of the people who have contributed to
our project
today so thank you everybody
you

# CLIAPI: Revolutionizing Command-Line Interface Design

Welcome to today's talk on **CLIAPI**, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to standardize and enhance the development of Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs). Inspired by the success of OpenAPI in the realm of RESTful APIs, CLIAPI aims to address the complexities and challenges inherent in CLI design, fostering consistency, extensibility, and improved user experiences.

## Introduction

Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are powerful tools that allow users to interact with software through textual commands. Despite their efficiency and flexibility, CLIs often suffer from inconsistencies, lack of standardization, and steep learning curves. These challenges can hinder usability, automation, and interoperability across different CLI tools.

**CLIAPI** emerges as a solution to these problems by providing a standardized specification language for defining, documenting, and validating CLIs. By leveraging YAML and adhering to structured conventions, CLIAPI ensures that CLIs are both human-readable and machine-parsable, facilitating automation and integration with various tools and platforms.

## The Evolution of CLIs

Historically, CLIs were the primary means of interacting with computers. Early systems like UNIX introduced foundational commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `grep`, and `rm`. While these commands are powerful, their inconsistent naming conventions and lack of intuitive design often make them challenging to learn and use effectively.

Modern CLIs, such as Git, Docker, Kubernetes (`kubectl`), and AWS CLI, have built upon these foundations, introducing more complex command structures and functionalities. However, the absence of a unified specification language means that each CLI evolves in isolation, leading to fragmentation and increased difficulty in maintaining and integrating these tools.

## Introducing CLIAPI

**CLIAPI** is designed to bridge the specification gap in the CLI ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive framework for defining CLI commands, options, arguments, plugins, extensions, and advanced features, CLIAPI enables developers to create consistent and maintainable CLIs.

### Core Features of CLIAPI

1. **Hierarchical Command Structure**: Supports nested commands and subcommands, allowing for complex and modular CLI designs.
2. **Extensive Option Definitions**: Facilitates the definition of global and command-specific options with detailed attributes such as data types, default values, and validation rules.
3. **Plugin and Extension Support**: Enables the integration of plugins and extensions, allowing CLIs to be extended with additional functionalities.
4. **Marketplace Integration**: Provides specifications for interacting with a marketplace of plugins and extensions, including browsing and installation commands.
5. **Configuration Management**: Defines global and repository-specific configurations, supporting environment variables and settings management.
6. **Voice Controls and Accessibility (a11y)**: Incorporates voice settings and accessibility features to make CLIs more inclusive and user-friendly.
7. **Integration with Hygen and LLM-Powered Code Assistants**: Supports integrations with code scaffolding tools like Hygen and AI-powered code assistants, enhancing automation and developer productivity.

## Enhancing CLI Design with CLIAPI

Designing a CLI with CLIAPI involves several key considerations to ensure that the tool is intuitive, consistent, and powerful. Let's explore how CLIAPI addresses common CLI design challenges.

### 1. Standardizing Commands and Options

One of the primary benefits of CLIAPI is the standardization of commands and options. By defining a clear and consistent structure, CLIAPI eliminates ambiguities and ensures that users can predict and understand CLI behaviors across different tools.

**Example: GitHub CLI Advanced Features in CLIAPI YAML**

```yaml
cliapi:
  metadata:
    name: "GitHub CLI"
    version: "2.35.0"
    description: "A command-line tool for interacting with GitHub, supporting advanced features like plugins, extensions, marketplace integration, TOGAF framework commands, and comprehensive configuration management."
    author: "GitHub, Inc."
  commands:
    - name: "gh"
      description: "GitHub CLI main command for interacting with GitHub repositories and services."
      global_options:
        - name: "--version"
          description: "Display the version of GitHub CLI."
          type: "boolean"
        - name: "--help"
          description: "Show help information for GitHub CLI."
          type: "boolean"
      subcommands:
        - name: "repo"
          description: "Manage GitHub repositories."
          options:
            - name: "--public"
              description: "Create a public repository."
              type: "boolean"
            - name: "--private"
              description: "Create a private repository."
              type: "boolean"
          arguments:
            - name: "name"
              description: "Name of the repository."
              required: true
          examples:
            - "gh repo create my-repo --public"
            - "gh repo clone my-repo"
          subcommands:
            - name: "clone"
              description: "Clone a repository to your local machine."
              options:
                - name: "--depth"
                  description: "Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits."
                  type: "integer"
              arguments:
                - name: "repository"
                  description: "The repository to clone."
                  required: true
              examples:
                - "gh repo clone owner/repo"
                - "gh repo clone owner/repo --depth 1"
    # Additional commands omitted for brevity
2. Supporting Plugins and Extensions
Modern CLIs often support plugins and extensions to extend their functionalities. CLIAPI provides a structured way to define and manage these add-ons, ensuring that they integrate seamlessly with the core CLI.

Example: Plugin Specification in CLIAPI YAML

yaml

plugins:
  - name: "octo-org/octo-plugin"
    description: "A plugin to enhance GitHub CLI with additional organizational tools."
    commands:
      - name: "octo"
        description: "Organizational tools provided by the octo-plugin."
        subcommands:
          - name: "sync"
            description: "Synchronize organizational repositories."
            options:
              - name: "--force"
                description: "Force synchronization even if conflicts exist."
                type: "boolean"
            arguments:
              - name: "organization"
                description: "Name of the organization to synchronize."
                required: true
            examples:
              - "gh octo sync octo-org --force"
3. Integrating Marketplace Features
CLIAPI facilitates the integration of a marketplace, allowing users to discover, install, and manage plugins and extensions directly from the CLI.

Example: Marketplace Commands in CLIAPI YAML

yaml

marketplace:
  - name: "GitHub Marketplace"
    description: "A marketplace for GitHub CLI plugins and extensions."
    subcommands:
      - name: "browse"
        description: "Browse available plugins and extensions in the GitHub Marketplace."
        options:
          - name: "--category"
            description: "Filter by category."
            type: "string"
          - name: "--sort"
            description: "Sort results by criteria (e.g., popularity, date)."
            type: "string"
        arguments:
          - name: "query"
            description: "Search query term."
            required: false
        examples:
          - "gh marketplace browse --category productivity"
          - "gh marketplace browse --sort popularity"
      - name: "install"
        description: "Install a plugin or extension from the GitHub Marketplace."
        options:
          - name: "--source"
            description: "Source repository of the plugin or extension."
            type: "string"
            required: true
        arguments:
          - name: "item-name"
            description: "Name of the plugin or extension to install."
            required: true
        examples:
          - "gh marketplace install gh-extras/gh-deploy-plugin"
4. Configuration Management
Effective configuration management is crucial for maintaining consistent CLI behaviors across different environments. CLIAPI allows for the definition of global and repository-specific configurations, supporting environment variables and settings management.

Example: Configuration Settings in CLIAPI YAML

yaml

configurations:
  globals:
    editor:
      description: "Default text editor for GitHub CLI operations."
      type: "string"
      default: "vim"
    pager:
      description: "Default pager for displaying command outputs."
      type: "string"
      default: "less"
    theme:
      description: "Color theme for GitHub CLI output."
      type: "string"
      default: "auto"
  repository:
    default_branch:
      description: "Default branch name for new repositories."
      type: "string"
      default: "main"
    visibility:
      description: "Default visibility for new repositories."
      type: "string"
      default: "private"
5. Enhancing User Experience with Voice Controls and Accessibility
CLIAPI recognizes the importance of making CLIs more accessible and inclusive. By incorporating voice settings and accessibility features, CLIAPI ensures that CLIs cater to a broader range of users, including those with disabilities.

Example: Voice and Accessibility Settings in CLIAPI YAML

yaml

voice_settings:
  voice_format:
    description: "Audio format for voice recording."
    type: "string"
    default: "wav"
  voice_language:
    description: "Specify the language for voice using ISO 639-1 code."
    type: "string"
    default: "en"

accessibility_features:
  screen_reader_support:
    description: "Enable support for screen readers."
    type: "boolean"
    default: true
  high_contrast_mode:
    description: "Enable high contrast mode for better visibility."
    type: "boolean"
    default: false
  keyboard_navigation:
    description: "Enable keyboard navigation for CLI interactions."
    type: "boolean"
    default: true
6. Integrations with Hygen and LLM-Powered Code Assistants
CLIAPI supports integrations with code scaffolding tools like Hygen and AI-powered code assistants, enhancing automation and developer productivity.

Example: Integrations in CLIAPI YAML

yaml

integrations:
  hygen:
    description: "Integrate Hygen for code scaffolding."
    commands:
      - name: "hygen"
        description: "Code scaffolding using Hygen templates."
        options:
          - name: "--template"
            description: "Select template for scaffolding."
            type: "string"
            required: true
        arguments:
          - name: "component-name"
            description: "Name of the component to scaffold."
            required: true
        examples:
          - "gh hygen --template react component Button"
          - "gh hygen --template node service AuthService"
  llm_code_assistants:
    description: "Integrate LLM-powered code assistants for enhanced code generation and assistance."
    commands:
      - name: "assist"
        description: "Interact with LLM-powered code assistants."
        options:
          - name: "--prompt"
            description: "Provide a prompt for the assistant."
            type: "string"
            required: true
          - name: "--model"
            description: "Specify the LLM model to use."
            type: "string"
            default: "gpt-4"
        arguments:
          - name: "code-file"
            description: "File to apply assistant's suggestions."
            required: false
        examples:
          - "gh assist --prompt 'Optimize this function' main.py"
          - "gh assist --prompt 'Generate unit tests' src/utils.py --model gpt-4-turbo"
Addressing Common CLI Design Challenges with CLIAPI
Consistency and Discoverability
One of the significant challenges in CLI design is ensuring consistency across commands and options, which enhances discoverability and reduces the learning curve. CLIAPI enforces standardized naming conventions and structures, making it easier for users to navigate and utilize CLI tools effectively.

Extensibility and Customization
Modern CLIs need to adapt to evolving user requirements and integrate with various tools and platforms. CLIAPI's support for plugins, extensions, and marketplace integrations ensures that CLIs can be extended and customized without compromising their core functionalities.

Enhanced Documentation and Validation
CLIAPI's machine-readable specifications enable automated generation of comprehensive documentation and validation of CLI configurations. This ensures that CLIs are well-documented, reducing ambiguities and errors, and facilitating easier maintenance and updates.

Accessibility and Inclusivity
By incorporating accessibility features and voice controls, CLIAPI ensures that CLIs are inclusive and cater to a diverse user base, including those with disabilities. This not only broadens the usability of CLIs but also aligns with modern standards of accessibility.

Identifying and Bridging Gaps in CLIAPI
While CLIAPI offers a robust framework for CLI specification, certain gaps need to be addressed to enhance its effectiveness and adoption.

Dynamic Command Generation
Gap: Modern CLIs often support dynamic command generation based on runtime contexts or configurations. CLIAPI currently lacks mechanisms to define dynamic commands that adapt based on user input or environment states.

Solution: Introduce conditional command definitions and dynamic parameter assignments within CLIAPI to support adaptive CLI behaviors.

Interactive and Non-Deterministic Operations
Gap: Some CLI operations involve interactive prompts or non-deterministic outcomes based on user interactions. CLIAPI does not currently provide specifications for defining interactive elements within commands.

Solution: Develop a specification framework within CLIAPI to define interactive prompts, conditional flows, and user-driven decision points within CLI commands.

Enhanced Validation Rules
Gap: CLIAPI supports basic data types and validation but lacks advanced validation rules such as regex patterns, range constraints, and cross-field dependencies.

Solution: Expand CLIAPI's validation capabilities to include regex-based validations, numerical ranges, and conditional dependencies between options and arguments.

Comprehensive Tooling Support
Gap: The effectiveness of CLIAPI is heavily reliant on supporting tooling such as validators, documentation generators, and code scaffolding tools. Currently, there is limited tooling available to fully leverage CLIAPI specifications.

Solution: Invest in developing a comprehensive suite of CLIAPI tools, including IDE plugins, automated validators, and integration modules for CI/CD pipelines to enhance usability and adoption.

Versioning and Compatibility Management
Gap: While CLIAPI includes versioning support, it lacks detailed mechanisms for managing backward compatibility and handling deprecated commands or options.

Solution: Implement a versioning schema within CLIAPI that allows for deprecation notices, backward compatibility flags, and migration paths to facilitate seamless transitions between CLIAPI versions.

Extensibility for Diverse CLI Paradigms
Gap: CLIAPI is designed with a generic approach, but some CLIs follow unique paradigms or specialized workflows that CLIAPI may not fully accommodate.

Solution: Introduce extensibility points within CLIAPI specifications, such as custom command attributes or plugin hooks, to support specialized CLI paradigms without compromising core standardization.

Future Directions for CLIAPI
To fully realize its potential, CLIAPI must continue to evolve by addressing the identified gaps and incorporating feedback from the developer community. Future enhancements may include:

Dynamic Command Support: Enabling adaptive command definitions based on runtime contexts.
Interactive Features: Incorporating specifications for interactive prompts and conditional command flows.
Advanced Validation: Expanding validation rules to cover more complex scenarios.
Robust Tooling: Developing comprehensive tools to support CLIAPI specifications, including validators, documentation generators, and IDE integrations.
Community Engagement: Fostering a community around CLIAPI to drive adoption, gather feedback, and contribute to its evolution.
Conclusion
CLIAPI represents a significant advancement in the standardization and enhancement of Command-Line Interfaces. By providing a structured, machine-readable specification, CLIAPI addresses many of the existing challenges in CLI design, including consistency, extensibility, and user experience. While there are still gaps to be bridged, the ongoing development and community engagement will ensure that CLIAPI continues to evolve and support the diverse needs of modern CLI tools.

By adopting CLIAPI, developers can create more intuitive, maintainable, and powerful CLIs, ultimately fostering a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem for both developers and users.

ChatGPT

Thought for 16 seconds

Certainly! Before diving into creating a DSLModel that represents a CLI command execution, it's important to recognize some common misconceptions that can lead to ineffective or incorrect model designs. Here are some wrong assumptions people sometimes make about CLI command executions:

Common Wrong Assumptions
Commands are Linear and Simple

Misconception: Each command execution is straightforward with a single command, a set of options, and arguments.
Reality: CLI commands can be complex, with nested subcommands, multiple layers of options and arguments, and dependencies between commands.
Options and Arguments are Uniform

Misconception: All options and arguments follow the same structure and behavior.
Reality: Options can vary in type, requirement, and dependency on other options or arguments. Some options may be mutually exclusive.
Execution Context is Ignored

Misconception: The context in which a command is executed (e.g., current directory, environment variables) doesn't need to be modeled.
Reality: Execution context can significantly affect command behavior and outcomes and should be considered in the model.
Error Handling is Overlooked

Misconception: Errors can be handled generically without specific modeling.
Reality: Different commands may have specific error types and handling strategies that need to be captured.
Commands are Static

Misconception: CLI commands do not change over time once defined.
Reality: Commands can evolve, with new options added, deprecated features, and version-specific behaviors.
Ignoring Asynchronous Execution

Misconception: All CLI commands execute synchronously.
Reality: Some commands may involve asynchronous operations, requiring support for async execution in the model.
Assuming All CLI Commands are Independent

Misconception: CLI commands operate independently of one another.
Reality: Some commands may depend on the outputs or states resulting from previous commands.
Overcomplicating with Too Many Fields

Misconception: To capture all possible aspects, include too many fields in the model.
Reality: Overly complex models can become unwieldy and hard to maintain. Focus on essential aspects.
Ignoring Security and Permissions

Misconception: Security aspects like required permissions are not part of the command execution model.
Reality: Security and permission requirements are critical and should be represented.
Assuming All CLI Commands Use Similar Syntax

Misconception: All CLI commands use similar syntax structures.
Reality: Syntax can vary between different CLI tools, requiring flexible modeling.
Creating a DSLModel for CLI Command Execution
Considering the above misconceptions, here's a robust approach to creating a DSLModel that accurately represents a CLI command execution:

python

from dspygen.utils.dsl_tools import DSLModel
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any, Type, TypeVar
from pydantic import Field, ValidationError

T = TypeVar('T', bound='CLICommandExecution')


class CLIOption(DSLModel):

    description: str = Field(..., description="Description of the subcommand.")
    options: List[CLIOption] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of options available for the subcommand.")

    examples: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Example usages of the subcommand.")
    subcommands: Optional[List['CLISubcommand']] = Field(None, description="Nested subcommands.")

    options: List[CLIOption] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of options applicable to the command.")
    arguments: List[CLIArgument] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of arguments required by the command.")
    examples: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Example usages of the command.")
    subcommands: Optional[List[CLISubcommand]] = Field(None, description="Nested subcommands under the command.")
    dependencies: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="List of dependencies required before executing the command.")
    security_requirements: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Security requirements for executing the command.")


class CLICommandExecution(DSLModel):
    command: CLICommand = Field(..., description="The CLI command to execute.")
    arguments: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Arguments provided to the command.")
    options: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Options provided to the command.")
    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Execution context, such as environment variables or current directory.")
    async_execution: bool = Field(False, description="Whether the command should be executed asynchronously.")
    error_handling: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Error handling strategies for the command execution.")
    post_execution_tasks: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = Field(None, description="Tasks to perform after the command execution.")
    pre_execution_tasks: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = Field(None, description="Tasks to perform before the command execution.")
    version: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Version of the command execution, useful for tracking changes or updates.")

    # Additional fields can be added as needed.


# Example Usage

try:
    # Define a command
    clone_command = CLICommand(
        name="clone",
        description="Clone a repository to your local machine.",
        options=[
            CLIOption(
                name="--depth",
                description="Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits.",
                type="integer",
                required=False,
                default=1
            )
        ],
        arguments=[
            CLIArgument(
                name="repository",
                description="The repository to clone.",
                required=True
            )
        ],
        examples=[
            "gh repo clone owner/repo",
            "gh repo clone owner/repo --depth 1"
        ]
    )

    # Define a command execution
    clone_execution = CLICommandExecution(
        command=clone_command,
        arguments={"repository": "owner/repo"},
        options={"--depth": 1},
        context={"current_directory": "/path/to/clone"},
        async_execution=False,
        error_handling={
            "retry": 3,
            "on_fail": "log"
        },
        post_execution_tasks=[
            {"task": "notify", "channel": "slack", "message": "Repository cloned successfully."}
        ]
    )

    # Serialize to YAML
    yaml_output = clone_execution.to_yaml()
    print(yaml_output)

except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"I/O error: {e}")
Explanation
CLIOption and CLIArgument:

CLIOption represents an option for a CLI command, capturing its name, description, type, default value, whether it's required, and any aliases.
CLIArgument represents a positional argument for a CLI command, detailing its name, description, and requirement status.
CLISubcommand:

Allows for nested subcommands within a primary command. It includes options, arguments, examples, and further nested subcommands, enabling the modeling of complex CLI hierarchies.
CLICommand:

Represents a top-level CLI command. It includes global options, arguments, examples, subcommands, dependencies (other commands or conditions that must be met before execution), and security requirements (permissions or access controls needed).
CLICommandExecution:

Encapsulates the execution details of a CLI command. It includes the command itself, provided arguments and options, the execution context (like environment variables or current directory), whether the execution is asynchronous, error handling strategies (like retry mechanisms or logging), and any pre/post execution tasks (such as notifications or additional commands).
Best Practices
Modular Design:

Break down commands into modular components (commands, subcommands, options, arguments) to allow for reuse and easier maintenance.
Explicit Definitions:

Clearly define each aspect of the command execution, including dependencies and security requirements, to avoid ambiguity.
Context Management:

Include context information to capture the environment in which the command is executed, ensuring commands behave predictably.
Error Handling:

Define comprehensive error handling strategies to manage failures gracefully and maintain robustness.
Extensibility:

Design the models to be extensible, allowing for additional features like async execution, pre/post tasks, and integrations with other tools.
Versioning:

Incorporate versioning to track changes over time, facilitating upgrades and backward compatibility.
Additional Considerations
Dynamic Command Generation:

Incorporate mechanisms to handle commands that change based on runtime contexts or configurations.
Security and Permissions:

Ensure that security requirements are well-defined to prevent unauthorized command executions.
Asynchronous Operations:

Support asynchronous command executions to handle long-running tasks without blocking the CLI.
Pre/Post Execution Tasks:

Allow defining tasks that should run before or after the main command execution, enhancing automation and workflow integration.
By following this structured approach and avoiding common pitfalls, you can create a robust and flexible DSLModel that accurately represents CLI command executions, ensuring consistency, scalability, and ease of use across various CLI tools.

Action Packed AI Coding Devlog
what's up Engineers Indie Dev Dan here I have an action-packed AI coding Dev log
for you today I'll be commenting over this AI coding session to share insights
and techniques with you we'll be using the best two AI coding assistants AER
and cursor to do all the heav lifting for us in this new bun code base I'll
show you how you can use these two tools together to ship more code in less time
we'll also show off the secret sauce of AI coding it's likely not what you think
it's not really cool or interesting but as you advance in your engineering career you learn that using this pattern
will greatly increase your engineering productivity in both speed and
quality so right away I want to share something really cool with you that can
help you get up and running with AER across code bases AER has this do
Configuring Aider for Optimal AI Coding
configuration yaml file where you can effectively configure anything you can
think of so right now I'm going through enabling sonit 3.5 prompt caching I'm
disabling autoc commits I prefer to commit myself and now I'm setting up something
really interesting I'm setting up this test command and this auto test
flag this hints at the secret sauce but we'll get into that more later in the
video we're setting up some more Flags here this is a really cool feature AER
has you can specify readon files that will not get updated when you're
prompting they won't be included as an option for AER to update so I'm adding the read me and
this conventions file so what is the conventions file this is a really interesting pattern that's emerging with
Conventions File: Guiding AI Code Generation
AI coding tools conventions are rules that you want your AI coding assistant
to follow as their writing code for you so you can see here just a markdown file
and I'm just going to write a couple bullet points here with details about
how I want AER to write code in this code base this is the great part about
Setting Up the Project Structure
this AER configuration file so you can have a base configuration file that you
use AC cross code bases and then you can update it on a per code base basis so
we're creating some project structure here I created the modules and the tests
and the types file I'm really curious here how do you like to handle your typescript types do
you have them all in a single file or do you have them spread across
features logical groupings or you know individual components comment down below
how do you like to store your typescript files in your
codebase I've been using this pattern of having a single types file on the top
level and it's worked out really well it's easy to search it's easy to find
types and llms love that they can find all the types in a single
file so just working through our configuration
here I'm moving the types to the file key value pair and I'm also adding the
index.ts so now whenever we boot up AER we're going to get these files
so little mistake here I actually misnamed the AER configuration file it's
do comp not config so after we fixed that we can reboot AER and now you can
see automatically we have prompt caching enabled and we have our conventions read
me index and types files automatically added to our context window so that's
awesome now I'm going to update the readme with a reformatted version of our setup nothing too crazy happening
here all right so we're opening up a new window here using my BD Alias to kick
off the index file and we got hello via Bond so that's all working great now
we're going to start setting up our notion client so what are we working on here what are we actually building we
are setting up a notion API wrapper class so a product I'm working on right
now needs to have support for running crud operations on notion Pages I'm
First Aider Prompt - setup bun main
going to run the first AER prompt I'm just going to say add main to index.ts and this is just kind of a
standard pattern where you have a main function that kicks off the flow of your application so we do that and I'm just
going to go ahead run that AER is just going to immediately suggest that command so we ran that and something
really cool happened there um you know due to our auto test flag uh AER
automatically ran BUN test after our prompt this is a really really powerful
pattern as we progress in this AI coding Dev log you'll see exactly how impactful
that can be so we're going to go ahead create a couple additional files here we're going
to create our notion module which will hold all of our Logic for our notion
wrapper class we've added both those notion files to our context window
Creating the Notion Wrapper Class
here so now we're going to update notion and create our notion wrapper class
right so this is going to be a simple prompt that initializes our notion class
that we can reuse across the life cycle of the application so just firing that prompt
off here we are of course using Sonic 3.5 there's really no other model to use
for top tier coding
results you can see here we have a brand new notion rapper
class so this looks great now it's time to start setting up our tests so I'm
running an update command for our test and basically we just want a simple Bond
test that is going to run git page for
us so we're frying that prompt off and you can see that test automatically
Auto testing with Aider
was run thanks to our auto test configuration
so it is mocking a lot of codee in that test so what we're going to do right now is we're going to move our notion page
ID into that test file so when you're building on notion
when you're using the notion API you always specify notion page ID and in order to use this in both the
test and the rest of the application we're just going to go ahead and move that into our brand new constants
file so this is really cool I was able to prompt AER and just ask for a brand
new file uh we have an error here this before each doesn't exist needs to be
imported and this is just something that was missed so AER automatically asks if
it can you know fix the change I said yes and it went ahead and fixed that
particular issue so we were running into another issue here where notion page
ID uh is trying to match the result ID which is not what gets returned there so
what I'm going to do here is manually run this test again and just print out the
result and what I'll do now is ask for this code to get
updated ask for the test in particular to get updated and then I'm just going to paste in the response blob right so I
don't really care what this test validates against I just wanted to validate
against something right so I'm going to pass that object into AER and it's going
to update the test and basically just fix it so you know validate against
something more legitimate so you can see there now it's checking against page emoji
icon and uh the actual title of the not page so
that's great I deleted a couple items there we only need one of those to really validate the
test so now we're going to update our index.ts notice this pattern that I'm reusing right in the beginning I say
update or create and then the file colon and then I specify what exactly there
you know in that file or files we want to change so right now we're going to
Building a CLI Application with Commander
update our index.ts and we want to create some type
of CLI application where we can run multiple commands to test the different
pieces of our notion API wrapper so we're going to use Commander for that this is really nice bun is asking us if
we want to or sorry AER is asking us if we want to automatically run bun add
Commander which is the CLI package
we went ahead and said yes for some reason it also generated this git page list method which doesn't exist so I'm
going to go ahead and clean that up here this is I think one of maybe two
hallucinations throughout this AI coding session so all right so we're going to
remove this get page list this is going to be a simple prompt I'm just going to say remove get page list
and it doesn't exist anywhere else so I'm just going to drop it from the index.ts you can see I've modified
index.ts so I need to reload this file there's the updated version with our
brand new Commander CLI application so that looks great again reusing this AI coding
AI Coding ADD, Delete notion block
prompt pattern you say the action and then the file and then you describe what
you want to happen in that action right so I'm saying create ad text
I'm using a function like syntax here this is really important specifying the
typescript type of our parent block there and I'm also saying update the
test as well right so this is really cool ader is doing all the heavy lifting for us here updating multiple files at
the same time all we did was create you know a two sentence prompt maybe really
like one and a half so this is great um again I want you to really pay attention
to this pattern here two tests automatically pass we just created a new test our code is getting validated with
every single prompt we're running and you know we're just getting started here we only have two methods
but that pattern is already doing a lot of work for us so you can see here in the notion page we have our ad test
actually creating a new notion block for
us and you know here I'm going to try to run two at the same time um getting a
little conflict error there um I'm not even sure that's the right bash command to to run back to
back but nevertheless we have our new ad command
working great and you know I am kind of flipping back
and forth between notion and our CLI application mostly just to show you I'm
using another keyword here this mirror keyword we've talked about this in previous a coding devlogs but it's super
useful for replicating patterns and here I'm just going to say you know we want a
delete block command and function so
we're going to get that updated in our c C and in our notion. TS notion rapper
class I noticed that it did not create a test for us you can see there are still only two tests so I'm just going to
quickly reprompt and say create a test for
deletion again you can see this pattern doing a lot of work for us after every prompt it's running every test uh our
SECRET SAUCE of AI Coding
code is getting automatically validated for us this is the secret sauce of AI
coding it's very likely that in the future we'll have a bunch of AI coding
testing agents that will use tests to validate
that they're working properly right so how do you know that your code is working and what's the fastest easiest
way for a llm to know that they did the right
thing the feedback loop of l m and agentic workflows is a massive kind of
open question there's a lot of value there and if you can crack that your agentic workflow becomes so much more
powerful and your product becomes so much more powerful because your AI
agents can self- validate so this is going to be a pattern that we're going to see in AI
coding assistants moving forward the ability to create tests to validate the
code that they just wrote is incredibly
powerful um all right so what are we doing here we are updating our CLA
application I just want some usage docs some usage comments above every
Automatic test resolution with Aider
single uh method here and you can see I'm using the hashtag symbol here pound
symbol AER CAU that as an error and is automatically fixing it for us it knows
we're in jsts land and we need slash slash I go back and forth between Python
and typescript all the time so a little bit of language blurring going on
there and now I just want to test out this delete block command so I'm going to copy this block ID in notion and
after we run this so we're going to you know get the actual ID which is just the final
segment here and after I've run this we should see that block get completely removed
right so just walking through with that usage command shout out to
cursors cursor tab feature and there we go there is that
block has been completely deleted deled so now we know that that is working our test automatically validated
that for us but you know it's nice to see things visually and now we're going to keep
moving so so what's next we have this really great structure
and pattern we have kind of three levels one is our actual notion wrapper class
the other is our tests and then the top level is our index CLI application right
so we have kind of one Central code level and then two above it that
effectively just validate that it works properly so we're going to update our
notion test file and we want to test this case where we want to add a block that has a parent I'm asking for a new
test for this since it'll just reuse the ad text function
so we're going to move our mock parent ID to our constants file we'll see that
automatically pop in there from
AER awesome so we got that automatically written and again
you can see our automatic tests validating everything we're doing we can see that new test was created and
validated if we search all our mock parent block ID will take us right to
that
test I'm just going to run this test by itself you you can update you can use
the only function on your tests to you know
run individual tests you can also just update the AER configuration file to run
you know only the test file that you're working on so say you're working on a
new feature you don't need to run every test right that would be a lot in some code bases um you know in some code
bases you'll have hundreds of files you don't want to be rerunning that with every PR to run so you know you can dial
it in focus in on just the feature you're working on it's a high output pattern to rerun
all the related tests after every single
prompt so now we're going to fix our example docs so you can see there we
have this like a line 25 line 15 uh this notion - CLI this is the
second hallucination I just want to kind of remove that I don't want that to be notion C I want it
to be bu run so you can see there
that got updated at least
mostly and all of our tests ran so we've got three methods working
right now that's great we are missing a big one right we now need a read all
method so you know get page blocks which will get all of the content from our
notion page so this is a tricky function as you'll see we actually need
to not only get the blocks but we need to for each block get the correct type
Multi-file prompting - Get page blocks function
of the block and potentially if the block has children we need to also recurse on each block so we'll get to
that one step at a time we're going to run a multifile
prompt here create a new typescript type and we're going to create a brand new
method so I asked for three files to get updated here and AER is going to update every single
file we're kicking off our test you can see we have five tests running now and
now we're just going to inspect our git blocks function so you can see there it's only
pulling in paragraphs which is something important to need to address
but we did miss our get page blocks on our index.ts Command level so I'm just
going to go ahead and add that I didn't actually you know explicitly add that into my the update portion of my prompt
so AER listened and it didn't update that file right uh if we run that get the results
out of that um I'm actually going to add it to the clipboard here you can see this is what our git text looks like so
you can see we're missing a lot of text that's because of what I mentioned earlier right we're only parsing
paragraph items so I'm looking through the notion
examples to parse text from any block type so we don't just want paragraphs we
also want you know URLs we want embeddings we want uh math equations we
want code blocks and in order to support this I'm going to go ahead
AI Coding pattern - Documentation as context
and first off add this code in a new docs file so this
is another AI coding pattern that you can utilize ize to add documentation right so
basically this is just a markdown file that contains you know docs or code or both
surrounding a specific topic right so I'm adding a new readon file this is
really cool in AER you can add readon files so it's never an option to update
that file and I'm going to add parse content. markdown into our readon file
context I created this new notion utils file and now I'm going to say update
notion utils I want to implement the
code inside of our parse content markdown file right so I want that block
parsing functionality inside this notion utils file so this is a pretty powerful
prompt we're really digging into the value of AI coding right the ability to
read large pieces of information much faster and then write the code again
much faster than you or I right doesn't really matter if you're pushing out 150
words per minute with no mistakes um the AI coding assistant will
be able to outcode you so you can see here our notion utils
got updated and it's looking pretty good we're looking through the changes here we're
going to want to make a couple tweaks to um to the type it's only storing the
block ID and the text and as you can see on line 87 it's
actually storing the text and the type together in this weird string so uh
we're going to update that we going to say update the simple block type to include a new key value
pair you might be asking why didn't I just manually add that well as you can
see here we're updating multiple files now based on that one edition right the
test got updated the top level index file got updated and the actual code itself got
updated right and then after all that every single one of my tests ran right so you can see here I'm coding with AI
faster than never before I'm also validating the changes faster than ever before because AER is
effectively operating as both an AI coder and an AI testing agent so I hope
you can kind of see all the value that I'm getting out of this tool right
now here's another great feature uh it just coded an error it noticed that and
it immediately fixed the error I I actually don't even know what went wrong
Improving notion blocks - recursion
but uh there was some lenting error and it resolved it immediately um so you know we're
reducing cognitive load we're reducing the amount of decisions we need to make on a micro level so we can focus more in
the macro level right so here you can see I'm printing out all the blocks once
more we don't have any empty uh text blocks anymore but we are
getting this weird output format uh where we're you know specifying the type and we don't have any of our nested
items right so all of our nested blocks basically were ignored so we're going to go ahead
and fix that here you can see in the search none of our nested items are getting picked up that's because a notion you need to
recurse underneath a specific block so we're going to make that change
right now we're going to again we're using this
same pattern you want to say update and then you specify the file or files and
then you say what exactly you want to have changed right so now the prompt the
AI agent the llm is localized it's scoped to this specific block of code
right or this specific file or files so I'm updating to say you know
this parse blocks method should return our type and if it sees has children
equals true it needs to recurse uh and call itself again to get
all the children underneath it so again this is something that would
take uh even the fast engineer quite a bit of time um and this is something
that you'd kind of have to walk through manually to make sure you're getting all the logic right um I'm not doing that
right I'm asking my AI coding assistant what I want I'm waiting I'm reviewing
the changes validating it with tests automatically and then I'm moving on so
you can see here we have a error here um we have a we updated the type it's not
going to return a string it's going to return an object now so AER picked up on that it asked if it could make the fix I
said yes of course and now it's making the fix it's rerunning all the tests and it's automatically validating
that change right this is I know I keep repeating this but you know engineering coding Building Products is all
repetition it's about doing the right thing over and over and over and getting yourself locked into these patterns that
make it hard for you to do something wrong you can see there we now have our
nested content which is awesome and we have the
you know every single one of our nested blocks is now showing up in our
output um I'm going to make another change here we are missing the parent ID
so I'm just going to come into ader here using that same AI coding prompt
pattern update notion utils and then I'm saying uh you know I only want the text
block to be the block
content and I guess it's in a a future prompt where I add the parent ID but
this is going to clean up the text so that we're only getting the actual block contents uh the block text
content awesome so using cursor here to uh locally update this file the way I
Not Aider vs Cursor - Aider AND Cursor
like to use AER and cursor together is I like to use AER for my big multi-file
changes across the codebase in a specific context setting and then I use cursor for as you'll see
here like to use cursor for uh in
file uh block specific code changes right so I use cursor to kind of dial in
a change and I use AER to make multiple changes across multiple files over a
longer session and of course you can use cursor to do both but uh I find that AER has
higher accuracy and it's a lot simpler and
concise so here I'm going to update the notion utils once again and I'm also
going to say update the types as well because we need this new block
ID and that's it so I'm just saying add parent block ID right and again AER
updating both those files and again AER via the auto test configuration running
all my tests a lot of validation happening here
a lot of uh engineering happening kind of automatically if you will right
so you can see here we now have our blocks in Json format thanks to that
cursor prompt and we also have this parent block ID so now every you know we
have this really clean flat array with the parent block ID specified when they
exist and when they don't they're null so this is fantastic right our
notion API wrapper is is fully Alive we can read we can write we can delete
we're doing a lot in a small amount of time so we're going to make a couple additional changes here I'm going to say
update notion we're going to update test we're going to update index we're looking for an update block command so
you know right now we have create delete read we need to finish the crud and make
sure that we can actually update so I randomly forgot here that we could update text and using
the notion API so I just asked AER using the SL ask command uh if that was
possible so uh it was kind of a dumb question it definitely is possible just kind of like had a brain glitch
here um you know it's another kind of cool way you can lean on your AI coding assistant just ask a question at
random and now I went ahead made that change updated those three
files and you can see there it created that brand new test should update block
if we crack open that test you can see it looks pretty
good I want to update the initial text here so I'm using a cursor prompt for
that cursor selection prompt and I just want it to be a little bit different and I wanted to assert
that it wasn't that value so just being a little uh particular about the test
here and then I add the only modifier to the test just to test that one one
method right so that's a quick way to you know isolate your tests and validate one test so we got
that running we now can update um notion
nodes so here's a manual test manual validation there really is no harm in
you know double triple validating your code um the only cost of course is time
but I'm going to come in here and just you know use some cursor tabbing to
automatically get this CLI command in the right
form and uh you know creating a nice update message there writing code with AI is crazy so
true and now we're just going to go Ahad and run that Command right so now we're going to see that block updated
Use many GenAI Tools not one - think top three
fantastic that is up live and running so so we're just going to make some updates
here updating the read me with some additional documentation kind of showcasing how
things work so you know these these next couple of prompts are all about that I want to comment on either versus cursor
and this tool versus that tool that model versus that model you know for the time being at least thinking of gen AI
tools as you know one ring to rule them all or one tool to rule them all it just
sets you back it's much better to think of your toolkit as you know a top three
or top five list where you go between these tools you use them together you
learn you learn the good parts and the bad parts about specific tools as we said in our previous AER video it's
really too early to put all your eggs in one basket it's too early to pick winners so I recommend just as a
engineering principal you know in the age of generative AI don't pick a single favorite or best tool pick you know one
2 3 or four play with them understand them pick out the pros and cons and just kind of give it all time for things to
emerge give it time for these tools to emerge and also you know if you see something that's missing in the
ecosystem you know you can build it that's the the beautiful thing about these AI coding tools it's never been
Reflections on AI Coding and Future Course Announcement
easier to build out these tools yourself so you can see here we now have
usage documentation for a brand new notion API wrapper that looks beautiful
it's a in place uh just kind of doing some code review here uh we did all this
in I think 40 45 minutes this is a you know part one of a
two-part series there are so many incredible things we can do with these tools and I really like this AI coding
devlog format for that reason right I can sit down write code with AI and then
really reflect and share my process with you so I am actively building an AI coding course it's going to contain a
crap ton of value for you it's going to be the most comprehensive principled and
practical course on AI coding I want to release it right after the next class of
models drop so I can you know include any of the new Innovations and AI coding
that will happen so stay tuned for that I'm really excited to release that to you for you that's going to be a big
win-win situation in the next video we'll push this code base further if that interest you like sub stay focused
keep building and I'll see you in the next one

# Serialize the CLISession to YAML
yaml_output = cli_session.to_yaml()
print(yaml_output)
Explanation
Class Definitions:

CLIExecution: Represents a single execution of a CLI command. It includes details such as the command executed, options and arguments used, timestamp, output, success status, and any error messages.
CLISession: Represents an entire CLI session, encompassing multiple CLIExecution instances. It includes a unique session ID, start and end times, the user who initiated the session, environment details, and the list of command executions.
Representing the Transcript:

The provided transcript describes a developer named Dan using AI coding assistants (AER and Cursor) to manage and automate various tasks in a project.
Each significant action taken by Dan (like configuring AER, adding read-only files, creating or updating files, running tests, etc.) is represented as a CLIExecution instance within the CLISession.
Timestamps are added to each execution to indicate when the command was executed. These are illustrative and can be adjusted based on actual session data.
Serialization:

The CLISession instance is serialized to YAML format using the to_yaml method, allowing for easy storage, sharing, or further processing of the session data.
Notes:

Error Handling: In this representation, all commands are marked as successful (success=True). If there were failures, the success field would be set to False, and the error_message field would contain relevant error details.
Extensibility: The models can be extended with additional fields as needed, such as more detailed environment settings, user roles, or specific execution contexts.
Automation: This structure facilitates automated analysis of CLI sessions, enabling features like session replay, auditing, or performance monitoring.
By utilizing these models, organizations can standardize the representation of CLI interactions, making it easier to track, analyze, and optimize command-line workflows.

Explanation:

CLIExecution:

Represents each individual command executed during the CLI session.
Fields include:
command: The exact CLI command executed (e.g., aider config).
options: A dictionary of options and their values provided with the command.
arguments: A list of positional arguments passed to the command.
timestamp: The exact time the command was executed.
output: The output returned by the command.
success: A boolean indicating whether the command executed successfully.
error_message: Contains the error message if the command failed; otherwise, it's null.
CLISession:

Represents the entire session of CLI interactions.
Fields include:
session_id: A unique identifier for the session.
start_time: When the session began.
end_time: When the session ended.
executions: A list of CLIExecution instances representing each command executed.
user: The username of the individual who initiated the session.
environment: A dictionary capturing the environment settings during the session, such as the editor used, operating system, shell, and AI assistants involved.
Representing the Transcript:

The provided transcript narrates Dan's AI-powered coding session using aider and cursor.
Each significant action (like configuring aider, adding files, creating or updating classes, running tests, handling errors) is mapped to a CLIExecution instance.
The session captures both successful commands and those that encountered errors, demonstrating how aider assists in automating and validating code changes.
Timestamps are illustrative and should be adjusted based on actual session times.
Serialization:

The CLISession instance is serialized to YAML using the to_yaml method, making it easy to store, share, or process the session data further.
This structured representation allows for comprehensive tracking and analysis of CLI interactions, facilitating better understanding, auditing, and optimization of command-line workflows.




You said:

[Music]
all right
hi everybody uh thanks so much for
joining me today i'm going to be talking
about
designing for the command line um so
first i just thought i'd start off with
i'm talking about just what is it
exactly that a command line interface
is so anytime um you're
What is a command line interface?
interacting with your computer you're
really just kind of telling it to do
something
and a command line tool is how you tell
it to do something using text instead of
clicking a button
um i think it's really helpful to
remember that this is what computers
used to be they were really only text
interfaces they were
just terminals and this is what
computers were like
when unix was being created and unix
is the operating system that's the basis
for a lot of
the basic concepts that we take for
granted today
and one of those concepts is the nested
file system
so very well familiar with this but
relatively quickly
from those text interfaces we move to
using these kinds of graphic interfaces
they're what we call gui's
but that original text interface the
command line still exists
and is used today so this is the text
version of what it is you just saw
so this means change directory or folder
into the github cli folder and then list
the contents of that folder so really
all cli
r is a way to interact with your
computer and the files on them
so unix comes with all of these out of
the box commands
uh you just saw cd and ls
and while these commands are all really
powerful and foundational
they can be really hard to understand
there's not a consistency to how they're
named
and it's not very obvious um what they
are or what they do
or how you might use them so just to
give you a sense of
what these commands look like um so if
you write cat
with the file name like what would you
maybe expect this to do
um it actually at its most basic just
outputs the contents of that file uh cat
stands for concatenate um
grep is how you search for strings
within a file and greps
actually stands for global regular
expression print
so these are just terms that you kind of
have to just learn
so that would just output that line that
matched that string i passed it
and rm means remove or delete so this is
how
i would delete this file and that
actually just outputs nothing
um which is pretty boring right uh
because unix
follows this principle called no news is
good news
so basically if everything goes fine
just say nothing
so a lot of that design was intended to
limit the amount of characters that were
being used because screens at the time
were small
and keyboards uh could be uncomfortable
to type on so
um and some of these commands are
actually so obscure
that they were literally just inside
jokes uh from berkeley or bell labs
back in the 70s i think this one might
be a little bit of an urban legend
but you can see that uh this command
biff
was actually just named after someone's
dog who used to bark at the mailman
so i don't think that this command is
used very frequently anymore but i think
this really illustrates
um how these things were happening and i
think it's also important to note that i
don't think these commands
were being designed with like this this
kind of longevity in mind they didn't
realize how popular or how long-standing
these commands would end up being
so these problems actually existed
already back in the in the early 80s
as unix was becoming more popular so
this is a
um article that um don norman the author
of everyday things wrote
before he even published um his book um
and he criticizes a lot of these things
that i've been talking about
and at large like these things really
still exist today because
we really did move on to graphic
interfaces and the terminal kind of got
left behind
and that brings me to git in addition to
these out-of-the-box
unix commands uh people make additional
command line tools so you could think of
them kind of like
apps for your terminal and so git is a
version control tool and that is what
github is powered on
so as a command line tool you can see
that git is an improvement on these out
of the box commands and that it uses
whole words
um but this is still kind of confusing
so what do these words mean what does
rebase mean what does commit mean
and these are concepts that you have to
learn outside of just memorizing these
commands to use in a certain order
so this is actually um a quote from a
parody interview so this is not a real
quote just to be very clear
um but this is a quote from a parody
interview with linus torvalds who's the
creator of git i saw this quote floating
around the internet a lot and it took a
lot of work for me to figure out that
this was not a real quote which i think
says something about how it resonates
i'm just using this to say that a lot of
people really struggle with these
concepts
and they really always assume it's their
fault or like they're not a real
developer because these things are hard
to learn
but it's not it's really just that these
things really weren't designed to be
simple to pick up
but so all of this said people do
use command line tools for a reason and
they've persisted in their current form
for a reason i think this really boils
down to the fact that it's really the
ultimate power tool it's
interacting with your computer without
any guard rails and you can do whatever
you want with that
so things that people love um people
love
uh being able to automate really tedious
tasks
um they can move really fast because of
that it's very flexible you can compose
these different commands together string
them together to do what you want
and i think people also really value um
the experience of using the terminal so
they build up a muscle map muscle memory
to go really fast they don't have to
take their hands off the keyboards and
you always have a history of actions
above you
and i think a little bit you get to feel
like a hacker in a 90s movie
but something i like to think about a
lot is just how much people really like
to learn
in general but i think especially on
github because they come to github
to code and to collaborate with other
developers and these are really
important skills to have
so if we assume that this is what a
learning curve looks like for these
things today
we i really think that we can make these
things easier to learn
without necessarily oversimplifying them
so people are more than capable of
learning hard things and they should but
there's so much we can do to make these
things less obscure and less arcane
so you could argue that that's all fine
because
people who are novices prefer graphic
interfaces anyway
and people who are advanced developers
just will pick up
command line tools with no problem but i
think maybe this is true in a really
large strokes but i don't think it's
it's more accurate to say
that people really do just feel safe and
trust
whatever it is they were they were
taught first so i've talked to a lot of
advanced developers who prefer
using graphic tools because they're like
why would i not just click on a button
if i can click on a button
and i talk to a lot of beginner to
intermediate folks who
prefer command line tools because that's
what they were taught and that's what
they're comfortable with now
and of course it's always important to
remember that everyone is a beginner at
some point
that brings me to making vh github cli
gh is a tool that sits alongside git and
fun fact it did actually come out of
beta this morning
so that's exciting um
when i talk to a lot of people about my
work i get questions like what is it
exactly that you're designing like what
do you do
day to day so just to make that super
clear up front
um what i design is the commands we
should make so together with my team
we thought that it would be really
valuable for people to be able to list
their issues from the command line
so we decided that that command would be
named
gha2list with the filter state closed
we decided what that would output so it
would show the list
with things in red with the columns um
and we also decide how people discover
them so how can we help people know
to open up a blank terminal and know how
to type gh issue list
so taking a step back just our overall
goals with the project
uh we wanted to bring github concepts to
the terminal so there's a lot of
concepts
within github that don't exist in git
Our goals
and we wanted to enable people to be
able to script and automate with those
things
and we also really wanted to reduce
context switching between
the terminal and the and the website the
github website so this is a
quick overview of just what it can look
like day to day for a developer to move
between github.com and the terminal
so this might not seem like that big of
a deal but i really think it's similar
to the phenomenon of when you walk
through a door
and you like totally forgot why you went
in that room in the first place
and so that friction really adds up over
time and
we saw um just a really a great
opportunity to bring all of these things
together
so while we might not build every single
thing that exists on github we saw a lot
of value in letting you do your core
things from where you already are
so like i mentioned earlier these are
things that people love
and so these are the things we wanted
the size in anything we design
and these are the things that we can't
get in the way of when we're designing
as well
and these are the things that we want to
mitigate so there's a total lack of
affordances
uh command line tools can be really
unforgiving of mistakes even for
advanced developers like you hit the
command and there's
it just deletes something and there's no
way to undo that so it's kind of scary
sometimes to work with it
it relies on memory a lot there's all
these commands that you have to keep in
your head all the time and memorize and
different command line tools do it in
different ways
and overall it just really makes you
think a lot
so i think this feeling is really
encapsulated by this like
you open up a blank terminal and you
just have this cursor just kind of
mocking you
so uh when you're designing anything
visually these are really the variables
you have at your disposal
you and we really do have most of these
things when we're designing for the
command line
we still have color we still have space
we don't have type size because all
of the type is the same size but we can
format things and make them bold we can
add icons through unicode we definitely
don't have images
but we do have language which i think is
our most important tool
so early on when i was designing uh i
really wanted to just get a sense of
what was possible so i spent some time
looking for just the absolute wackiest
command line tools i could possibly find
and this one is my favorite so
this is actually a globe that someone
made in the terminal and this act just
totally
blew up away like any sense of what i
thought was possible
um and i think it's really cool to see
that despite the fact that there's no
images
in the command line this person was able
to create a map of the entire world
i also spent some time looking for games
that people make on the command line
so this is a typing test that someone
made
and i just really loved this as an
example of a really clear and simple
interface that's still fun so this was
another great example to help me just
understand what constraints i was
working with
Generating possibilities
so after gathering all that inspiration
i worked together with my team
to generate as many possibilities as we
could and go as wide as we wanted
and we actually did that in google docs
so it turns out if you
make the background black and use a
monospace font google docs really feels
like terminal
so this was a great opportunity for us
to figure out together
what we wanted to do and what we didn't
want to do
and how interactive we wanted to get and
how we wanted to talk to our users
and you can see in our comments here it
was a really great way for us to discuss
right in line what it was that we liked
what we didn't
and this is really how we nailed down
what we thought the interaction of this
tool should be
so this is actually still what i use
today um i have this template that has
kind of like our loose
design system in it and this is how this
is my jumping off point for any tool
um and we still use this today i really
hope that we can actually open source
this so that our open source
contributors can use this to
um share their ideas with us so these
are just some
higher fidelity designs that i've done
recently
so to give you a sense of what we made
um so what it what life is like with gh
What we made
and without gh
so right now when you're checking out
someone else's pull request or when
you're reviewing their code
basically you have to use these few
different git commands and no one can
ever remember them
i've talked to a lot of people who
complain that they always need to google
it every time they need to do it and now
we have that
as just one simple command
um to clone someone else's project
um right now you need to go to the
project you need to copy the url
and then you can clone that project and
go back to the terminal do that and if
you know the project name you can
actually now do that just
in wall line gh brings just the entire
concept of issues to the command line
so issues don't exist at all in git so
that now you can
create issues list issues view issues
all right from where you already are
and lastly when you're creating a
project
right now it's pretty annoying because
you have to create it locally in your
terminal and then you have to go
to the website connect the two things
and now again you can just do that in
one line
so i think the biggest thing that i
learned is that
designing for the command line is really
the same as designing for anything else
we so we have those design constraints i
talked about
um and just to give you a sense of what
it's like to
use these design constraints so that say
this is some raw output
this is what it's like to add space um
this is what it's like to make some
things bold so you can already see
there's some
hierarchy building up adding color
and adding some icons so i think you can
really see how just using a light touch
with these
variables you can make outputs so much
easier to look at and
easier to understand
um so people also that's not so people
also
just customize all of these things so
people customize their colors
their fonts they can make aliases so
they can just completely rename
the commands that you made for them so
that same command i just showed you this
is what it might look like in someone
else's terminal
the concept of home so any product is
going to have a concept
like some kind of landing experience so
this is ours
so this is what we call a help page and
this is
um how we give people a jumping point to
explore the rest of the tool and read
about it and understand
what it does um so we make sure that
this is really concise and easy to
understand
so that people can from the get go just
learn
and explore on their own we think about
accessibility
we worked with some consultants who work
with github and one of my favorite
things
we learn from them is that when someone
is using voiceover and
reading this a bunch of spaces
don't actually read as a pause so right
now
this line would read as issue create and
view issues which doesn't make sense as
a sentence it's really hard to
understand
so we add colons and colons more
reliably
read as a pause so this now will read as
issue create and view issues and so now
that's a lot easier to understand
as a sentence we think about
discoverability
so discoverability is probably the
toughest thing to deal with on the
command line
but i think the way we get around that
is having a really clear and consistent
language system
designing this early really allowed us
to find holes in our own system
so for example like we decided to not
use the word open
because open could be misconstrued as
open an issue
or open in the browser so we decided to
just use that and stuck with using
create or or view instead
um and i think the most important part
of this is that it helps people memorize
and it helps people predict how things
work across the whole tool
and all of this also exists on our docs
site so you can
peruse that at your own leisure
apologies if you can hear any noise in
the background i have a parrot who's
screaming
um but anyway um i designed
also a way for people to go from the
website
down locally so these are
ways for people to introduce themselves
to the tool and also
it's ways for us to teach you a little
bit about how the tool works
we try to encourage good behavior so
this is something i actually worry about
a lot in our tool so
if you strip away all of the context um
from github
um like avatars and people's names and
we also make it easy for people to move
faster and script things
how can we still encourage people to you
know behave well on our platform
um a small way we do that is by adding
issue templates
to any creation flow so these are really
important for project maintainers
because it helps
people write good issues so we make sure
to include that step
from the command line as well
and i think just overall making things
simpler and easier just helps people
follow best practices a little better
so the principle of no news is good news
that i mentioned at the beginning this
is actually a rule that we decided to
bend or even break because
we are you know working on modern
computers with modern keyboards so we
thought that that was a good
reason for us to be able to be a little
more verbose
than most command line tools so we do
actually show success messages so
there's no
experience where you hit it and then
just nothing happens and it's weird and
you don't know what happened
so we do show a success message lets you
know that the thing that you wanted to
do did happen
and you're in this new state we also
show
some context setting headers so before
we added these people would do things
like
create pull requests in the wrong
repository or they wouldn't really know
what list they were looking at
so i think these headers really just
help you
like know where you are and know what
you're doing and it's a really helpful
way for
you to just think a little less
understand what's going on and make you
feel a little more secure in what it is
you're doing
for riskier actions that are difficult
to undo we make sure to include a
confirmation step
so i think all of these things together
just contribute to a sense of comfort
and
a sense that we're looking out for you
so preferences we don't necessarily have
like a setting cog in the corner
um but we do have a config file where
you can set preferences like your
preferred editor
we think about consistency so i think a
lot of what we do is just make its tool
feel familiar with what you already know
on github.com
so if you're familiar with github you
know that these colors really hold a lot
of meaning
so open is always green closed means red
merged means purple and we make sure to
reflect all of those locally as well
same here so you're for a pull request
you're always looking for
have my checks passed have my have money
has my code review passed
and we also reflect that state as
closely as we can as well
in general just a list of closed issues
will
still look and feel like a list of
closed issues
and we reflect flows as well that people
are familiar with
so if you merge a pull request you just
select the method
confirm it and then you can delete the
branch
and this is how we reflect that flow in
the tool so you
select the method um you can delete the
branch
not just on github now but also locally
and you see those
messages and their respective colors
that you're familiar with
we also asked for feedback so um in that
help page i showed you earlier
we have a few ways that we um like ask
you to
let us know like what you're thinking
and so we have this feedback form that
we've gotten a really a ton of really
awesome
really helpful feedback from and we also
prompt you to open an issue in our
repository using
the tool itself which makes me which
makes me smile
um this is just an example of my
favorite feedback that we've ever gotten
this just makes me laugh and i put it in
every presentation um we think about
surprise and delight uh we have had some
really fun hack days
and one of my favorite projects that
came out of that was this hack day
project by nate smith
and he made this project called repo
garden
and this actually makes a generates a
garden from the commencing your
repository
so i just think this is absolutely
beautiful
so it's kind of like a text adventure
where you're walking around this garden
and exploring the commits
in your project
lastly this tool is all open source so
this
is an example of me doing design review
with a contributor recently
and yeah lastly just designing for text
only interface really forced us to be
creative under all of these constraints
that i talked about today
and i'll leave you with this uh what
would the text only version be
of whatever it is you're designing i
hope it'll help you learn something new
or it'll help you see the problem with
new eyes because it definitely did that
for me
and as a final treat this is a command
called
gh credits another hack day project by
nate
and this is just a big thank you to all
of the people who have contributed to
our project
today so thank you everybody
you

Create a CLISession of a full usage of the gh by an expert do a demo of all features

2/2

ChatGPT

Thought for 31 seconds

Modeling the demo

The conversation involves crafting a CLISession model to depict an expert's demonstration of all "gh" CLI tool features, ensuring it accurately represents the video transcript.

CREATING DEMO CLICE Session: Summarizing the expert's "gh" usage into a CLISession, requiring accurate model fields and a detailed transcript. Progressing through each feature attentively.

Mapping out CRM integrations

I’m conceptualizing database classes for Salesforce and HubSpot, detailing their objects and relationships. This helps streamline CRM issues and ensures CRM data consistency.

Mapping out components

I’m considering the elements of scripting for CLIExecution and CLISession, focusing on accurate Python code and YAML serialization. The goal is to demonstrate "gh" features through a CLISession instance.

Laying out the essentials

I'm thinking through a comprehensive CLI session for "gh" commands. This includes issue and pull request management, as well as repository handling.

Mapping out the models

I'm considering how to model a CLISession with diverse CLIExecution entries in Python, using dspygen and pydantic, and then serialize the output to YAML.

Correcting terminology

OK, let me see. The script needs "gh" commands. I’ll define and compile CLIExecution and CLISession instances with various "gh" commands, then serialize everything to YAML.

Creating the demo

I’m preparing a CLI demo for "gh" features, setting up CLIExecution entries, serializing to YAML, and addressing any command name errors ("aider" to "gh").

Understanding commands

I'm working through simulating "gh" commands like issue creation and workflow execution, emphasizing plausible outputs and errors. This approach ensures a rich simulation experience.

Mapping out the process

I’m reconstructing the assistant's response by documenting the creation of a CLI session and associated executions, detailing commands, options, arguments, timestamps, outputs, and success status.

Defining CLI tasks

I'm piecing together several command-line operations such as cloning repositories, managing issues, and integrating workflows. This involves detailing classes and instances, serializing to YAML, and providing explanations for each major step.

Focusing on crucial elements

I’m refining the assistant's reply to prioritize CLIExecution and CLISession. Including classes is preferable for a self-contained explanation.

Tracking CLI sessions

I’m gathering details on CLIExecution and CLISession models. The CLIExecution model captures each command with its options, arguments, and outcomes like timestamp, output, success, and error message. The CLISession model tracks the session's start, end, user, environment, and all CLIExecution instances.

Moving forward

Including code snippets and their YAML outputs in the explanation was recommended for clarity. This approach enhances understanding effectively.

Tracking command actions

I’m charting the progress of commands like gh repo clone, gh issue list, and gh issue create, detailing their success, error messages, timestamps, and outputs.

Managing CLI commands

I’m considering a comprehensive CLISession demonstrating various "gh" features, including repo handling, issue tracking, PR management, workflow execution, and more, with a combination of successful and failed commands.

Balancing content angles

I’m combining error handling with Snapdragon for a comprehensive guide to showcasing the gh CLI tool effectively.

Explanation
Class Definitions:

CLIExecution: Represents each individual command execution within a CLI session. It captures the command name, options, arguments, timestamp, output, success status, and any error messages.
CLISession: Represents an entire CLI session. It includes a unique session ID, start and end times, the user who initiated the session, environment details, and a list of all CLIExecution instances that occurred during the session.
Modeling the Expert's "gh" CLI Session Demo:

Session Details:

session_id: A unique identifier for the session (session_002).
start_time & end_time: Define the duration of the session (09:00 to 10:30 UTC).
user: The expert's username (ExpertDev).
environment: Details about the environment in which the session took place, including the editor, operating system, shell, AI assistants used, and the version of the gh tool.
Command Executions:

Repository Cloning: Cloning the awesome-project repository with a depth of 1.
Issue Management:
Listing open issues with a limit of 5.
Creating a new issue titled "Add user profile page".
Closing the newly created issue.
Pull Request Management:
Creating a pull request to implement dark mode.
Listing open pull requests.
Merging the created pull request.
Workflow Management:
Listing available workflows in the repository.
Triggering a CI pipeline workflow.
Viewing the workflow details in the browser.
Release Management:
Creating a new release v1.2.0 with release notes.
API Interaction:
Making a GET request to list issues via the GitHub API.
Gist Management:
Creating a public gist with a deployment script.
Alias Management:
Setting an alias co for the checkout command.
Using the alias to switch branches.
Deleting the alias after usage.
Help and Documentation:
Accessing the help page to view available commands.
Error Handling:

Simulating an error when attempting to run multiple tests simultaneously, showcasing how the model captures failed executions along with error messages.
Serialization to YAML:

The CLISession instance is serialized to YAML format using the to_yaml method. This makes it easy to store, share, or further process the session data.
The YAML output accurately reflects the sequence of commands executed, their options, arguments, outputs, success statuses, and any errors encountered.
Key Features Demonstrated:

Issue Management: Listing, creating, and closing issues.
Pull Request Management: Creating, listing, and merging pull requests.
Workflow Management: Listing workflows, triggering runs, and viewing workflow details.
Release Management: Creating releases with notes.
API Interaction: Making direct API calls to GitHub.
Gist Management: Creating and managing gists.
Alias Management: Setting, using, and deleting command aliases.
Help and Documentation: Accessing built-in help for commands.
Error Handling: Capturing and reporting errors during command execution.
Best Practices Illustrated:

Comprehensive Tracking: Every command execution is tracked with detailed information, facilitating auditing and analysis.
Environment Context: Capturing the environment details provides context for the session, aiding in reproducing or debugging issues.
Error Reporting: Clearly capturing failed commands and their error messages helps in troubleshooting and improving workflows.
Automation and Efficiency: Demonstrates how an expert leverages gh CLI features to streamline development tasks, enhancing productivity.
Extensibility:

The models are designed to be easily extendable. Additional fields or classes can be incorporated as needed to capture more complex interactions or integrate with other systems.
By utilizing these models, organizations and developers can standardize the representation of CLI interactions, making it easier to track, analyze, and optimize command-line workflows. This structured approach ensures consistency, scalability, and enhances the overall efficiency of using CLI tools like gh.

## Abstract

In the evolving landscape of software development, the design of Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) plays a pivotal role in enhancing developer productivity and tool interoperability. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to designing a robust and scalable CLI tool, named **Rovo CLI**, by synthesizing principles from pragmatic programming, Python fluency, reactive messaging patterns, and concurrent system design inspired by Erlang/OTP. We introduce structured modeling of CLI sessions and executions using Python's Pydantic for data validation and YAML serialization. Additionally, we explore the integration of generative AI assistants to augment user interactions and streamline workflows. Through this interdisciplinary collaboration, we demonstrate how combining best practices from various domains can lead to the creation of efficient, user-friendly, and maintainable CLI tools.

## 1. Introduction

Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) have long been the backbone of developer workflows, offering unparalleled efficiency and control over software tools. Despite the rise of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), CLIs remain indispensable for their scriptability, resource efficiency, and ability to integrate seamlessly into automated pipelines. Designing effective CLIs requires a balance between power and usability, ensuring that advanced functionalities are accessible without compromising simplicity.

This paper introduces **Rovo CLI**, a sophisticated CLI tool developed through the collaborative insights of experts in Python programming, pragmatic software development, reactive systems, and concurrent programming. By leveraging Python's expressive capabilities, pragmatic principles for maintainable code, reactive messaging patterns for responsive interactions, and Erlang-inspired concurrency models for reliability, Rovo CLI exemplifies a modern approach to CLI design.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Structured Modeling with Pydantic

To ensure data integrity and facilitate easy serialization, we employ Pydantic models to define the structure of CLI sessions and executions. This approach guarantees that all interactions are validated against predefined schemas, reducing runtime errors and enhancing maintainability.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

class CLIExecution(BaseModel):
    command: str = Field(..., description="The CLI command that was executed.")
    options: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Options provided with the command.")
    arguments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Arguments provided to the command.")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp of when the command was executed.")
    output: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Output returned by the command.")
    success: bool = Field(..., description="Indicates if the command executed successfully.")
    error_message: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Error message if the command failed.")

class CLISession(BaseModel):
    session_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the CLI session.")
    start_time: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp when the session started.")
    end_time: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Timestamp when the session ended.")
    executions: List[CLIExecution] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of CLI executions in the session.")
    user: str = Field(..., description="Username of the individual who initiated the session.")
    environment: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Environment variables and settings during the session.")

For interoperability and ease of configuration management, we serialize the CLI session data to YAML. YAML's human-readable format makes it suitable for documentation, configuration files, and data exchange between tools.

python

import yaml

cli_session_yaml = cli_session.json()
parsed_yaml = yaml.safe_load(cli_session_yaml)
print(yaml.dump(parsed_yaml, sort_keys=False))
3.3 Integration of Generative AI Assistants
Leveraging generative AI assistants like Aider and Cursor, Rovo CLI enhances user interactions by providing intelligent suggestions, automating repetitive tasks, and facilitating complex workflows. These assistants are integrated into the CLI's execution pipeline, allowing for seamless augmentation of developer capabilities.

3.4 Concurrent and Reactive Design
Inspired by Erlang's concurrency model and reactive messaging patterns, Rovo CLI employs asynchronous command processing and event-driven architectures. This design ensures that the CLI remains responsive, scalable, and resilient under varying workloads.

4. Implementation
4.1 Defining the CLI Structure
The CLI is structured into primary commands such as find, learn, act, and integrations, each with their respective subcommands. This hierarchical organization aligns with pragmatic programming principles, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.

python

class CLICommand(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    subcommands: List['CLISubcommand'] = Field(default_factory=list)

class CLISubcommand(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    options: List[CLIOption] = Field(default_factory=list)
    arguments: List[CLIArgument] = Field(default_factory=list)
    examples: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None)
4.2 Plugin and Extension Architecture
Rovo CLI supports extensibility through plugins and extensions, allowing users to augment the CLI with additional functionalities tailored to their workflows. This modular approach fosters a customizable and scalable CLI ecosystem.

4.3 Accessibility and Voice Settings
Adhering to accessibility best practices, Rovo CLI incorporates features like screen reader support, high contrast mode, and keyboard navigation. Additionally, voice settings enable voice-command integrations, enhancing usability for diverse user groups.

5. Results
Through the implementation of structured models, YAML serialization, AI integrations, and concurrent design principles, Rovo CLI achieves a balance between power and usability. The CLI facilitates efficient repository management, issue tracking, workflow automation, and seamless integrations with other SaaS applications.

## Abstract

Over the past five years, the Command-Line Interface (CLI) ecosystem has undergone significant transformations, driven by advancements in voice interaction technologies and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of CLIAPI's evolution, emphasizing the incorporation of voice commands and LLM-powered assistance to enhance user experience and productivity. We explore the design principles, implementation strategies, and the impact of these innovations on developer workflows. By synthesizing insights from pragmatic programming, Python fluency, reactive messaging patterns, and concurrent system design, we demonstrate how CLIAPI has adapted to meet the growing demands for more intuitive and intelligent command-line tools. Our findings highlight the benefits, challenges, and future directions for integrating voice and LLM capabilities into CLIs, offering a roadmap for the next generation of developer tools.

## 1. Introduction

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) has remained a cornerstone of developer workflows, prized for its efficiency, scriptability, and flexibility. However, traditional CLIs often require memorization of commands and syntax, presenting a steep learning curve for newcomers and occasional hurdles for experienced users. Over the past five years, two key technological advancements—voice interaction and Large Language Models (LLMs)—have emerged as transformative forces poised to revolutionize the CLI experience.

**CLIAPI**, introduced five years ago, aimed to create a robust and scalable CLI tool by integrating principles from pragmatic programming, Python fluency, reactive messaging patterns, and Erlang-inspired concurrency. This follow-up paper delves into the subsequent evolution of CLIAPI, focusing on the integration of voice commands and LLM-powered assistance, assessing their impact on usability, productivity, and developer satisfaction.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Voice Interaction in CLIs

Voice-controlled interfaces have gained prominence with the rise of virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Their application in CLIs aims to reduce the reliance on keyboard input, enabling hands-free operations and enhancing accessibility for users with disabilities.

### 2.2 Large Language Models in Development Tools

LLMs, exemplified by models like GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Their integration into development tools facilitates intelligent code completion, documentation generation, and contextual assistance, bridging the gap between natural language and programming tasks.

### 2.3 Evolution of CLIAPI

Initial work on CLIAPI focused on structuring CLI sessions, executing commands with Pydantic models, and ensuring robust integration with AI assistants. This paper builds upon that foundation, exploring advanced features enabled by voice and LLM technologies.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Integrating Voice Interaction

To incorporate voice commands into CLIAPI, we leveraged existing speech recognition frameworks and developed a layer that translates spoken language into CLI commands. This involved:

- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizing libraries like [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) and integrating with APIs such as Google Speech-to-Text.
- **Command Parsing**: Mapping recognized phrases to CLI commands using natural language processing techniques.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Providing auditory and textual feedback to confirm command execution and handle errors.

### 3.2 Leveraging Large Language Models

Integrating LLMs into CLIAPI involved:

- **Contextual Assistance**: Embedding LLMs to provide real-time suggestions, error explanations, and command recommendations based on user input.
- **Natural Language Querying**: Allowing users to perform searches and fetch information using conversational language.
- **Automated Documentation**: Generating and updating help texts, command descriptions, and usage examples dynamically.

### 3.3 Data Modeling and Serialization

Continuing the use of Pydantic for data validation, we expanded the CLIExecution and CLISession models to accommodate voice and LLM interactions. YAML serialization was enhanced to support new data structures introduced by these features.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Voice Command Integration

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class VoiceCommand(BaseModel):
    spoken_text: str = Field(..., description="The raw spoken input from the user.")
    recognized_command: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The CLI command interpreted from the spoken text.")
    confidence: float = Field(..., description="Confidence score of the speech recognition.")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="When the command was recognized.")

def recognize_voice_command() -> VoiceCommand:
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening for command...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        spoken_text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        # Placeholder for command parsing logic
        recognized_command = parse_spoken_text(spoken_text)
        confidence = 0.95  # Example confidence score
        timestamp = "2024-10-01T10:00:00Z"
        return VoiceCommand(
            spoken_text=spoken_text,
            recognized_command=recognized_command,
            confidence=confidence,
            timestamp=timestamp
        )
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return VoiceCommand(
            spoken_text="",
            recognized_command=None,
            confidence=0.0,
            timestamp="2024-10-01T10:00:00Z"
        )
4.2 LLM-Powered Assistance
python

import openai
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class LLMAssistance(BaseModel):
    prompt: str = Field(..., description="The user's query or command for the assistant.")
    response: str = Field(..., description="The assistant's generated response.")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="When the assistance was provided.")

def get_llm_response(prompt: str) -> LLMAssistance:
    openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-004",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    timestamp = "2024-10-01T10:05:00Z"
    return LLMAssistance(
        prompt=prompt,
        response=generated_text,
        timestamp=timestamp
    )
4.3 Enhanced CLISession Model
python

from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CLIExecution(BaseModel):
    command: str = Field(..., description="The CLI command that was executed.")
    options: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Options provided with the command.")
    arguments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Arguments provided to the command.")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp of when the command was executed.")
    output: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Output returned by the command.")
    success: bool = Field(..., description="Indicates if the command executed successfully.")
    error_message: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Error message if the command failed.")
    voice_command: Optional[VoiceCommand] = Field(None, description="Associated voice command, if any.")
    llm_assistance: Optional[LLMAssistance] = Field(None, description="LLM assistance provided during command execution.")

class CLISession(BaseModel):
    session_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the CLI session.")
    start_time: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp when the session started.")
    end_time: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Timestamp when the session ended.")
    executions: List[CLIExecution] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of CLI executions in the session.")
    user: str = Field(..., description="Username of the individual who initiated the session.")
    environment: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Environment variables and settings during the session.")

# CLIAPI YAML Serialization

YAML serialization is a critical feature in CLIAPI, enabling the conversion of structured data models into human-readable YAML format. This facilitates easy configuration management, data exchange, and integration with other tools and services.

## Implementation Details

- **Pydantic Models**: Utilizes Pydantic for defining structured data models, ensuring data validation and integrity.
- **Serialization Process**: Converts Pydantic model instances into YAML format using Python's `yaml` library.
- **Deserialization**: Enables the reverse process, allowing YAML data to be parsed back into Pydantic models for manipulation.

## Example

### Python Code for Serialization

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

class CLIExecution(BaseModel):
    command: str = Field(..., description="The CLI command that was executed.")
    options: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Options provided with the command.")
    arguments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Arguments provided to the command.")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp of when the command was executed.")
    output: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Output returned by the command.")
    success: bool = Field(..., description="Indicates if the command executed successfully.")
    error_message: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Error message if the command failed.")

class CLISession(BaseModel):
    session_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the CLI session.")
    start_time: str = Field(..., description="Timestamp when the session started.")
    end_time: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Timestamp when the session ended.")
    executions: List[CLIExecution] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of CLI executions in the session.")
    user: str = Field(..., description="Username of the individual who initiated the session.")
    environment: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Environment variables and settings during the session.")

# Example CLI Session Instance
cli_session = CLISession(
    session_id="session_003",
    start_time="2024-05-01T09:00:00Z",
    end_time="2024-05-01T11:00:00Z",
    user="ExpertDev",
    environment={
        "editor": "Visual Studio Code",
        "os": "Windows 10",
        "shell": "PowerShell",
        "AI_Assistants": ["aider", "cursor"],
        "rovo_version": "1.0.0",
    },
    executions=[
        CLIExecution(
            command="rovo find search",
            options={
                "--query": "Project Plan",
                "--app": "Confluence"
            },
            arguments=[],
            timestamp="2024-05-01T09:05:00Z",
            output="Found 3 results in Confluence for 'Project Plan'.",
            success=True
        ),
        # Additional CLIExecution instances...
    ]
)

# Serialize to YAML
cliapi_yaml = cli_session.json()
parsed_yaml = yaml.safe_load(cliapi_yaml)
print(yaml.dump(parsed_yaml, sort_keys=False))
Benefits
Human-Readable Format: YAML's syntax is easily understandable, facilitating manual edits and reviews.
Interoperability: Enables seamless integration with other tools and services that support YAML.
Configuration Management: Simplifies the management of CLIAPI's configurations through structured and organized YAML files.

Convert these into the official CLIAPI to Typer
ChatGPT

Thought for 10 seconds

Certainly! Let's convert your Jinja2 templates into code that uses the official CLIAPI data models to generate a Typer-based CLI application and its corresponding tests. We'll use the CLIAPI definitions to populate the commands, options, and subcommands in your CLI.

Step 1: Understand the CLIAPI Data Models
First, ensure that you have the CLIAPI data models defined. These models include classes like CLIAPI, CLICommand, CLISubcommand, CLIOption, and CLIArgument. They represent the structure of your CLI, including commands, subcommands, options, and arguments.

Assuming you have already defined your CLI structure using these models (e.g., for the Rovo CLI), we can proceed to generate the Typer code.

Step 2: Update the Templates to Use CLIAPI Models
We'll modify your templates to iterate over the CLIAPI data models and generate the Typer code accordingly.

Updated cli_template
python

cli_template = """
import typer

app = typer.Typer()

{% for command in cli_api.commands %}
{{ generate_command(command, 'app') }}
{% endfor %}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
"""
Helper Functions for Template Rendering
We'll need to define helper functions to handle the generation of commands, subcommands, options, and arguments. These functions will be used within the Jinja2 template.

python

def generate_command(command, app_name):
    command_def = f"""{app_name}.command(name="{command.name}", help="{command.description}")\n"""
    command_def += f"def {command.name}("
    # Add options and arguments
    params = []
    for option in command.global_options:
        params.append(f'{option.name.replace("-", "_")}: {get_python_type(option.type)} = typer.Option(None, help="{option.description}")')
    command_def += ", ".join(params)
    command_def += "):\n"
    command_def += f'    """{command.description}"""\n'
    if command.subcommands:
        # Create a Typer object for subcommands
        sub_app_name = f"{command.name}_app"
        command_def = f"{sub_app_name} = typer.Typer()\n\n" + command_def
        command_def += f"    typer.echo('This is the {command.name} command.')\n"
        # Generate subcommands
        for subcommand in command.subcommands:
            command_def += generate_subcommand(subcommand, sub_app_name)
        # Attach sub_app to main app
        command_def += f"\n{app_name}.add_typer({sub_app_name}, name='{command.name}')\n"
    else:
        command_def += f"    typer.echo('This is the {command.name} command.')\n"
    return command_def

def generate_subcommand(subcommand, app_name):
    subcommand_def = f"""\n@{app_name}.command(name="{subcommand.name}", help="{subcommand.description}")\n"""
    subcommand_def += f"def {subcommand.name.replace('-', '_')}("
    # Add options and arguments
    params = []
    for option in subcommand.options:
        params.append(f'{option.name.replace("-", "_")}: {get_python_type(option.type)} = typer.Option(None, help="{option.description}")')
    for argument in subcommand.arguments:
        params.append(f'{argument.name}: {get_python_type(argument.type)}')
    subcommand_def += ", ".join(params)
    subcommand_def += "):\n"
    subcommand_def += f'    """{subcommand.description}"""\n'
    subcommand_def += f"    typer.echo('Executing {subcommand.name} subcommand.')\n"
    return subcommand_def

def get_python_type(option_type):
    type_mapping = {
        "string": "str",
        "integer": "int",
        "boolean": "bool",
        "float": "float",
        # Add other types as needed
    }
    return type_mapping.get(option_type, "str")
Updated pytest_template
python

pytest_template = """
import pytest
from typer.testing import CliRunner
from cli_app import app  # Adjusted to import your generated CLI app

runner = CliRunner()

{% for command in cli_api.commands %}
def test_{{ command.name }}():
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["{{ command.name }}"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "This is the {{ command.name }} command." in result.output

    {% for subcommand in command.subcommands %}
def test_{{ command.name }}_{{ subcommand.name }}():
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["{{ command.name }}", "{{ subcommand.name }}"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Executing {{ subcommand.name }} subcommand." in result.output
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
"""
Step 3: Render the Templates Using Jinja2
Now, we can use Jinja2 to render the templates with our CLIAPI data.

python

from jinja2 import Template

# Assuming `cli_api` is your CLIAPI instance with all commands defined
cli_template_code = Template(cli_template).render(cli_api=cli_api, generate_command=generate_command)
pytest_template_code = Template(pytest_template).render(cli_api=cli_api)
Step 4: Write the Rendered Code to Files
You can write the generated code to Python files.

python

# Write the CLI code to a file
with open("cli_app.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(cli_template_code)

# Write the test code to a file
with open("test_cli_app.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(pytest_template_code)
Full Example
Here's how everything comes together.

Step 5: Run and Test the Generated CLI
Now, you can run the generated cli_app.py and use the commands defined in your CLIAPI instance.

bash

python cli_app.py --help
You can also run the tests using pytest:

bash

pytest test_cli_app.py
Conclusion
By updating your templates and utilizing the CLIAPI data models, we've successfully converted your Jinja2 templates into a Typer-based CLI application that reflects the structure defined in your CLIAPI instance. This approach allows you to generate CLI applications dynamically based on your CLI specifications, ensuring consistency and reducing manual coding effort.

Note: Ensure that all dependencies (e.g., typer, pydantic, jinja2) are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

bash

pip install typer pydantic jinja2 pytest
